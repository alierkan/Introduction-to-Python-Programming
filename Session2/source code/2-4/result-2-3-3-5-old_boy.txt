 To start off; This is the one and only film that kept me quiet for a whole 5 mins after seeing it. I literally couldn't close my mouth, and yet there wasn't any sound coming out of it. Oldboy had such an impact on me that words are too little to describe that impact. Therefore this film is definitely in my top 3 films ever made. It belongs there because it has a massive ingredient that a lot of films seem to miss out on; a divine plot. Even though the acting and screenplay are world class, the plot is really the cherry on the cake.When it comes to screenplay Park Chan-Wook is unique (at least for western standards) in his way of filming. The colours are so vivid and it seems like he wanted every shot to be a piece of art. One tip: If you like the shooting in 'Oldboy', have a look at 'Sympathy for Lady Vengeance', the third part in Park's revenge-trilogy. It's even superior to the camera-work in 'Oldboy'. Don't, however, expect a story like Oldboy's, because you would be very disappointed.When it comes to acting and the music, this film is also one of the better films ever made. The music sticks in your head and every time I put in my Oldboy-DVD and the theme-song comes up, I'm just flooded with good memories (even though the plot doesn't have a single reason to be happy about). The characters are also presented very well by the outstanding cast. Especially Choi Min-Sik and Yu Ji-Tae set a very convincing performance. I really appreciate this film being respected as it should be, by having a place in the top 250. If, however, it was up to me it would be even higher in the ranking. I don't see why films like 'The Usual Suspects' or 'Memento', which are fantastic pieces of film-making and which without a doubt deserve a place in the top 250, are higher in the top 250 than 'Oldboy'. They serve the same cause; a fantastic plot. But those plots can't stand in the shadow or even come close to the plot of 'Oldboy'. The one and only reason is that those two films are better known and from a western production company. If we were all living in Asia, no doubt 'Oldboy' would be in the top 20 of all time. My advice to people who haven't watched this film yet: Go see it! This is definitely a must- see. If you have a weak stomach, pull yourself together and still watch it. Don't be as shallow as a lot of people here tend to be. Look beyond the violence and see the things I mentioned before: world class acting, cinematography, music and last but certainly not least the plot. Once you've opened yourself up you'll find a whole new world of cinema. Enjoy! 
 I've scored this a 9 but I think I may have been a little harsh! I have just read a review that says the reviewer cannot understand the hype. I can see no hype. Everything the film promised and more was delivered. This is a truly wonderful film. It is beautifully acted, brutally and painstakingly directed and as good a display of raw emotion as I have witnessed in any language. The story is gripping, the characters believable and well rounded, the emotion human and the feeling I was left with at the end of the film is one of awe. And that was after I had watched it twice. Honestly, this is a truly, truly wonderful film. Do not miss it under any circumstances! 
 After going through the comments, i must say i'm impressed how many people out there don't have a slightest clue of beauty or intelligent screenplays. there are so many comments from people that totally disliked the movie. which is plain and simple not possible, if you got an open mind and a open heart (and are not drunk). I would compare it to chocolate. You may find it too sweet and prefer bitter chocolate. or you like white chocolate more. Or you got diabetes and can only sometimes eat one. But people that totally dislike chocolate scare me to death. Same goes for Oldboy, you gotta admit some of the genius art-form it contains. Its everything in there. Its heartwarming , disgusting, intelligent, beautiful and lead with outstanding performance of any actor . You HAVE to like something, cause it wont get much better. Its chocolate. If you disliked the movie so much and on a constant basis, why even bother to write a comment? My guess is you just could not follow the movie at all. which is my only guess actually. well enough rambling.:::::::::: Bottom Line :::::::::If you call common sense, and a human heart your own and like "challenging" movies, go and see it NOW.(i recommend the original korean version with subs)I also recommend the pre- and sequel to this movie. (just browse Chan Wook Park) If you think "The Fast and the Furious" is the best movie ever made, please do not even bother to watch Oldboy, and spare others your "brilliant" reviews. 
 I decided to check this movie out after Ebert's 4 star rave review, and the cult status this movie has received (and was also intrigued by the sexy-looking Ultimate Edition), so I decided to rent it. I was VERY surprised at how different it was than I expected it to be - I expected a ton of violence and not much in the way of writing or acting. The first time I saw it, I wasn't blown away, just kind of like whatever.When I watched it for the second time, however, I really started to notice how well it's made, in addition to liking it more. Every shot is bursting with background detail, a great amount of attention on the production design (the theme of a certain color in a scene was restrained, yet perfectly balanced). The actors really gave it all, especially the 2 male leads who really blew me away. The music is a varied mix of beautiful classical music and some pretty cool techno. The screenplay is brilliant; the characters are developed very well, extremely complex, and the plot is not only ingenious, but the payoff and twists are 1000x better than any Shamaylan movie.Simply put, from a technical point of view, it's one of the best movies ever. From a critic's point of view, it is a very well-done movie that goes a little overboard in sex and violence, and is just a little strange. 
 I haven't written a comment on IMDb for about 3 years but was inspired to with this film. It is not very often that I come across a film by accident (World Movies on cable) and the spend the next day scouring the internet to find out information about it and can't get it out of my head! Anyway, yep there are plot holes, but Old boy borrows a lot from surrealism and you are meant to suspend your disbelief! I don't buy comments when people say "it is so unrealistic because he should've done this ..." because it is a surrealist film and meant to be unrealistic! For me the sign of a good film is if it sticks on your head! THis one surely does (althought I did have to look away a few times ... ) Loved it!!!! Work of cruel genius!!! (HOLLYWOOD - Please don't ruin it by remaking it!!!) 
 I looked at program for today and I saw movie "Oldboy". I read plot and I liked it. What I expected is decent thriller from very good South Korean cinematography,something like "Salinui chueok ". But once again I was wrong. "Oldboy" is masterpiece, so unusual from all other movies. I've seen lots of violence on screen and to me this isn't nothing new but I think that people under 18 really shouldn't watch this one. It's because movie is brutal and I don't think that younger ones would fully understand this one.To say something about plot is quite impossible because I don't know where to begin. If I start talking about the movie I could tell few important things and I know that people often read other comments because they didn't watch that movie. So,I'm going to say only what I read before watching this movie.On his daughter's birthday, Oh Dae-su gets drunk and soon he's arrested by the police. His best friend No Joo-hwan somehow manages to get him out of jail and when No Joo-hwan is making a phone call Oh Dae-su disappears. Someone kidnap's him and puts him into room during 15 long years.But one day he's released.That's the plot. Very interesting, you should watch this movie and then judge it. By the rating on IMDb this movie is in top 250 movies. Now I can understand why. This plot that I wrote doesn't reveal the greatness of the people who wrote the script. I bow to them because this movie is so good, with all those twists and it really represents a whole new wave of making a movie, of writing a script and of acting in it. About direction and actors I can say only good things. Director Park Chan-wook won prize Grand Jury at Cannes. That's enough about direction part. About actors. I can say that I'm impressed by one actor:Choi Min-sik. He's amazing in major role and he showed great potential. I hope I will see him again in some good movie.I cannot say anything more because I could reveal some secret and I don't wanna do that to all new viewers. Only a recommendation. Beautiful, intelligent masterpiece of movie that I highly recommend for everyone with strong stomach and too all of you who want to see one excellent, but sick story. 10/10 
 Armond White of the NY Press has called it a "virtuosic stupid movie". I think that's exactly right.Certainly the movie looks fantastic. I liked the surrealistic touches. I think the director has a real imaginative way of capturing the process of memory -- there's an extended flashback about 3/4 way through which I think is as well conceived and shot as anything I've seen. The acting is standout. Hell, I even liked the score.But the movie almost aggressively makes no sense.SPOILERS Leave aside for a moment the obvious plot holes, large and small -- although it's worth noting that there's a whole lot of them. Leave aside the contrivances, too: the endless special gadgets the bad guy comes up with just when he needs them, the rather magical view of hypnosis, Dae-Su's magical new abilities, the seeming omnipotence of the badguy. Let's assume all this is beside the point, and that we're supposed to take the movie more or less symbolically ala FIGHT CLUB (probably the closest reference).The movie doesn't make any sense thematically, either. What's it really about? The virtue of keeping your mouth shut? The movie seems to suggest that the bad guy's sexual relationship with his sister is just fine, the problem seems to be Dae-Su's big mouth. The movie rather laboriously teaches this: the sister kills herself because of the rumors which somehow the sister believes to be true (?); Dae-Su becomes convinced that he was, in fact, at fault; Dae-Su cuts his own tongue out; Dae-Su pleads that Mi-do never learn the truth; Dae-Su even ends up brainwashing himself via hypnosis to forget the truth -- or "keep his mind shut", in a sense. I mean, huh? This is a pretty juvenile kind of ethics, to be blunt about it. Although Dae-Su is the protagonist the movie really doesn't seem to be on his side. It also hints at a weird kind of passivity: for all of the hammer swinging and octopus eating, Dae-Su doesn't really do all that much: things are done to him, and eventually he begins to internalize the abuse given to him.Is it about the futility of revenge? One would think, particularly with the references to COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO. But leaving aside the notion that Dae-Su's tormentor's omnipresence seems to weigh against the notion of him and Mi-do doing anything, really, but take their lumps or try to fight back, the fact that Dae-Su is considered by the movie to have really "done" something makes any critique pretty complicated. Remember, in COUNT Dantes is a true innocent. His motives are as pure as revenge ever gets -- that's why Dumas's ultimate critique, his ultimate notion that revenge even for the Count is wrong works so well. The force is seen in isolation. Here, though, it seems more a case of Dae-Su learning how "bad" he really is. He shouldn't take revenge because he really IS at fault.I guess you could argue that the movie shows revenge is futile from the bad guy's point of view. Then why are we watching Dae-Su at all? Maybe the point is that everyone feels themselves righteous until they realize the true dimensions of their "sin". But I don't see a lot of people facing up to facts in the movie: I see a lot of denial, in fact. Dae-Su admits to his relatively "minor" sin but can't face up to his "major" one.After I saw this I read some interviews with the cast and crew, and apparently some of this vagueness is intentional -- we're supposed to be left unsure. Well, the movie is successful in that, but I think it's an unworthy goal, an abdication of the artist's responsibility. People have bristled at the charge that this movie is nihilistic, but if that really is the point, that the movie's supposed to throw up it's hands and say, "hey, I dunno, you figure it out", then that truly is nihilism.Ah well, I could go on, but I won't bore you. A virtuosic stupid movie indeed, I think: often amazing to watch but underneath the surface just a whole bunch of muddleheadedness. 
 Oldboy takes a hammer and "batters" its American equivalents, leaving them as pulped as a chewed up squid. Park Chan Wook displays what America misses with his ultra-stylish, ultra-violent thriller. Why watch Ben Affleck fail spectacularly to summon any displayable talent, when Min sik Choi serves up a memorable role as the disturbed, vengeful Dae Su Oh, in the second of the Vengeance trilogy. Park skillfully creates a compelling plot that will have you guessing through the entire film, up until the final shocking revelation. The Cinematography expertly done by Jeong-hun Jeong, who also worked on the follow up to this film, Chinjeolhan geumjassi. Everything about this film is done in style and panache and creates a memorable experience, and has many memorable scenes.Many people accuse this film of being "unrealistic". These people forget that this a film, not a documentary. No one complains About Star Wars being unrealistic, and rightly so. Films have a right to stretch out reality, don't forget the reason it does this is to be entertaining.Although the film has strong violence of a graphic nature, I advise you to watch it, if only to broaden your perspectives of world and Asian cinema. 
 I feel compelled to defend this film from some quite frankly unwarranted criticism. Although it isn't without its flaws, and all films have a few,it certainly isn't a one star film.What this film has is the ability to be sublime, shocking, ridiculous, mildly amusing and visually stunning which is some feat for any film.The sheer scale of the comments here suggests that here is a film that gets to you in one way or another. This film is as far away from Maborosi as you can get yet both films are up there as great pieces of cinema. I wont divulge the plot or end this comment with a Latin quote to reinforce my self importance i'll just say go and watch it, preferably if you're not too squeamish and don't mind subtitles.This film left me thinking about it the following day which is normally a good thing (atleast it shows my memory is working!) 
 This movie was awful, plain and simple. It will probably be revered by those who only see "films" and not "movies" and will therefore feel sorry for me for having such a limited understanding of the theatrical brilliance of this film, but I am secure enough in my intellect to say that this boring, self-aggrandizing and painfully drawn-out movie was a waste of two hours and nine dollars.I was suckered into seeing this by the inexplicable good reviews it had been receiving and came out of the theater thinking that those reviews had to have been written by over-excited film students and the aforementioned group of individuals who shun regular movies, perhaps for fear that they may actually enjoy one someday.The storyline is quite a promising one - a man is imprisoned for 15 years, never knowing his captor nor his crime. He is then abruptly released and given just five days to discover the identity and reason of the man who imprisoned him. However, the great concept soon disintegrates into a pathetic joke as Oh Dae-Su runs around beating people up, trying to have sex with a young girl who is attempting to use the toilet and eating a live, writhing squid (presumably for dramatic effect, as there is absolutely no other reason for it). All the while he is trying to figure out this horrible thing he did to earn himself fifteen years in jail, and when he finally finds out it is both ridiculous and a major letdown. His nemesis, a man who supposedly went to school with him when he was a young man, looks like a Banana Republic model twenty years younger than him. Hey, I know prison has been hard on Oh Dae-Su, but is it too much to ask to find an actor that looks a bit closer to his age? Of all the things wrong with this movie, this one seems like the easiest one to fix.And the big secret - the one that kept me in my seat for 90 minutes when I could have been out doing something productive - is some joke of a plot line involving incest and a rumor started in high school. Come on! Throw us a bone here - was that really the best they could do? I sat through stupid dialogue, over-acting, gloomy sets and gratuitous violence for this? (By the way - I'm not at all against violence in a film if it seems to fit the story, but in this case it seems I was forced to watch our hero knock out someone's front teeth and cut off his own tongue with a pair of scissors in order to distract me from figuring out I was wasting my afternoon watching a pretentious piece of garbage).Take my advice - do something else with your time and money. Or take your nine dollars and go see a lowly "movie" - one that you might actually enjoy. 
 Yes this is a twisted movie with plots that unravel slowly and sometimes there are scenes that are slow. But over all it's incredible. Some of the symbolism behind the scenes are stunning. You have to go deep to appreciate it. There is a lot of gore and violence that can turn you off, but I was simply amazed by the depth and width of some of the scenes.Without giving anything away, once the main character is released he meets a man with a dog. It's seems to be an irrelevant scene, but put yourself in a cage for 15 years and think about how you would act? What happens to that man? Isn't he also in a cage? Aren't we all? What is the symbolism of that man? How about the dog? Revenge to the main character in this movie is his life. Why? And you don't question it because you know what happened to him. He doesn't question it either.To me this was one of the greatest depictions of Oedipus or other Greek characters I've seen this decade in a movie. Nothing is new. If you liked "Requiem for a Dream" or "Blue Velvet." Consider this one. 
 Old Boy sucks! No, wait, let me rephrase that: Old Boy is a stylistically challenging, highly innovative, but ultimately hollow and repugnant exercise in genre film-making. And just to let you know where I'm coming from  'Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance' was brilliant; an unforgiving and touching descent into doom. In that movie everything that happened somehow had to. One action triggered the next one and we experienced a vicious circle of violence and revenge. The characters seemed trapped in their situation.In Old Boy our protagonist is also trapped, but you know the story, so I won't tell you again. So he's in this room and there is great sound design and camera work. But once he frees himself, the complications and problems multiply. The plot is at first close to incomprehensible as he stumbles from one situation to another. When the villain explains his schemes at the end and brings enlightenment, I just couldn't care anymore. The intriguing premise is destroyed by the revelation that it's all a contrived revenge plot by the bad guy.And contrived it is. The story only works by inserting endless flashbacks (full of bad pathos) and explanations. To keep the audience interested, we get gruesome scenes of murder, self-mutilation and general mayhem. As others have remarked, these scenes are well done, but serve no greater purpose. It's all a so-what comic extravaganza.Out of 'Old Boy' I got small pleasures and a lot of disappointment, courtesy of one of the most interesting directors working today. I liked (among other things) the infamous hallway scene, the actors, the fight with the bodyguard, the revelation of the Secret and the sequence of Oh Dae-su leaving his bad self behind at the end. Small pleasures, indeed. 
 This movie is horrible. You don't find out the plot line in the exact order I'm laying it out, but in the end this is all that has happened:Basically Incestuos Brother is having sex with his own Sister. The school finds out because Main Character sees them, and Sister kills herself.Fast forward many years later, Incestuos Brother has Main Character's wife murdered, and Main Character kidnapped for like 10-15 years. MC is eventually released but he has no idea why, or who captured him. He meets Young Girl, they fall in love, and have sex. Then you find out Young Girl is Main Character's daughter. (yeah I know pretty gross) Incestuous Brother is all angry about his Sister killing herself because Main Character went and told the entire school about their forbidden relationship. So he's held this 20 year long grudge, in which he murders MC's wife, locks the guy up for over a decade, then orchestrates him having sex with his own daughter?????? Seriously, how can you not be completely turned off by this movie at this point? I don't care how sad and bizarre your life is, or how desperately you need to latch on to oddball art, cinema, and music to make yourself feel unique and different than everyone else. There's really nothing enjoyable about this movie other than the cinematography. Every plot "twist" it just gets more disturbing and overly complicated. A good plot twist should leave the viewer going "wow, why didn't I think of that?" not "OMG what kind of sick %#@$% would even begin to think that?"The acting is sub par, and the characters are lame. Main Character just runs around talking about claiming revenge the entire movie. OK, I think everyone can follow this line of thinking. Someone took away your family, and kidnapped you for a long time, yeah I'd want to go bash some skulls in too. But then every time he should actually act on that revenge he wimps out and instead of killing some fool he lets them go in some attempt to unravel this overly complicated mystery behind WHY this was done to him. Incestous Brother is just this smug, cocky, stereotypical evil genius the entire film. Its a role thats been done a million times over and yet fanboys of this are raving about how DEEP the characters are. Please.And don't get me started on the action, or lack there of. Every fight scene is: Guy misses main character with right hook, MC punches him. Another guy misses MC with right hook, MC punches him. Every once in a while they stray from the dodge right hook, counter punch sequence with the occasional: guy swings delicate piece of wood at MC which shatters against wall, MC hits him with hammer. So lame.I was seriously angry I wasted a couple hours watching this and even angrier that it had such a high rating on IMDb. This movie should be ridiculed for the crap that it is. 
 This comment is meant mainly as a warning to the people who might be attracted to the title by its (temporarily)high user rating which I find frankly puzzling. The reasons why I didn't like this title are following:1. The directer must have had some doubts whether to make a Jackie-Chan-type of a flick or a dark Oedipian tragedy. As a result, in terms of genre, the film falls between two stools, as the tragic and comic elements clash and cancel out each other rather than make a harmonious whole.2. The characters' motives and behaviors are incoherent and unconvincing. Psychological truth and logic are sadly missing.3. Absurd casting. I don't blame the actors, for it is a hard thing to create a convincing character by acting alone, if there is scarce logic in the script. However, why is there an apparent age difference of about 15 years between the leading two actors, whose ages in the film can't differ by more than 3-4?4. To me the film was poor entertainment primarily because of point 2. If you can't find a character you could sympathize with it is hard to follow the story with interest. When you finally learn the reason of what happened to the main protagonist, it turns out to make no sense.5. Some films apart from being entertaining are also thought-provoking. Having seen this film, I began to wonder whether the thought the director tried to provoke was not that incestuous relationships could be perfectly wholesome and delightful. I cannot put any other construction on the ending. 6. The film is rife with totally unnecessary violence. Violence in a film (and elsewhere) is a good thing, if it serves an important and worthy purpose. Purposes can be different and I don't want to enter into this broad subject. Let me just say I don't object to violence in such films as "Saving Private Ryan", "The Passion of the Christ" or "The Pulp Fiction". In "Oldboy" the scenes of torture and suffering are prolonged and graphic (or aural). What for? I do not know. Personally, I don't derive any satisfaction from watching teeth being extracted with a hammer or hear a man cut off his tongue with scissors and then see him choking on his own blood etc. etc. 7. The film reminds me a little of Japanese porno mangas in its fixation on incest and young Asian girls' panties, urinating and the like. It appears there is a minority who actually enjoy this kind of thing. If you're one of them, you might find this film enjoyable.In short, I do not recommend this film either as entertainment or "food for thought". Where it isn't silly, it is disgusting. Don't waste your time. 
 It seems that some viewers assume that the only thing which can make the viewer dislike this movie is the graphic violence. In fact violence, both disturbing and cartoonish, is the last of "Oldboy"'s deep flaws. The characters are unidimensional, underdeveloped, primitive. The "intensity", an obsession and a goal in itself with this director, is served up with the cheapest of means. Let's not confuse a mindless shot of adrenaline with artistic worth. By the end of the movie, it seems that all the cards were exhausted so the script becomes almost inadvertently funny in its efforts to find new levels of "horror", to continue to "shock" an audience which is already numbed by the plethora of dumb soap-opera "revelations" already served up in big bunches. It would be hard to imagine anybody even vaguely familiar with the masterpieces of the last fifty years of Asian cinema being enthralled by this pompous piece of trash. Imagine Homer Simpson hesitating in front of the cinema theater: "should I go in or should I buy five cones of ice-cream for the same money?" Be smart, Homer, go for the ice-cream. 
 I am sorry to rain on everybody's parade. Just a little background about me: I like and know a lot about Asian cinema, especially Japanese, Chinese and Indian. Admittedly I am a novice when it comes to South-Korean cinema but, if this is the best of the best, sorry. I just want you to know that I am not at all narrow-minded when it comes to appreciating foreign movies and I do not fit the stereotype of the "dumb American" . . . well, not perfectly.I cannot believe the high praise this piece of nothing is bestowed upon. This is a disgusting *and* ludicrous movie. Hammy acting - everything is badly done and overdone, like begging for the uneducated viewer's attention. Horrible camera-work, with an insistence on meaningless close-ups derived from the MTV aesthetics.The plot is more full of holes than a gigantic piece of Swiss cheese. Nobody expects a thriller to be 100% realistic, and for the sake of entertainment I'd be happy to close my eyes to small unfitting details. But, excuse me, what's happening here that *can* stand even summary scrutiny? This story of an unbelievably intricate and contrite act of revenge is worse than the worst tabloid story one can read in a line at the supermarket. (Don't want to spoil your "enjoyment", if that's the word, so won't go into details of the plot.) The fighting scenes are violent, unbelievable, downright stupid (the main "hero" taking on dozens and dozens of opponents in the same time, after he ONLY trained while imprisoned, punching a wall ! ) The truly "outstanding" features of this movie are two: the lurid and incestuous sex (brother on sister and father on daughter, well, we've evolved since Oedipus, didn't we?) and the graphic violence. The cut off body parts - hands, teeth, tongues - together with industrial quantities of spilled blood (how many tens of thousands of tomatoes had to die for this movie to be made?) have no esthetical function/motivation whatsoever.A feast for the S & M inclined, admittedly, but, even for those, a feast of no merit nor subtlety. Heavens, even Mel Gibson's recent and much-discussed work on an almost similar theme wasn't THAT bad.The invariably good press this pretentious, overblown, overlong piece of gratuitous gore coming from Korean shores obtains makes me wonder what's happening. I don't think of myself as being the ultimate paragon of taste and often I am ready to accept that a movie I didn't enjoy may be better than I was able to perceive. However, I have no scruples whatsoever in calling this one as I see it: bad, bad, bad. No redeeming qualities. My 2c? Find something better to do with your time. 
 Hi! I am a South Korean national student here in London, and would like to give you some clues why the main character, Oh Dae-Soo, was kept in the private prison for exactly 15 years and why he ate the live octopus as I hope you all understand this film a little better.Firstly, his wife was killed one year after his being kept in the privately run prison. Obviously, Oh Dae-Soo didn't kill her but was suspected of murdering her. It must be done by Lee Yu-Jin who planned to have his sister's revenge upon Oh Dae-Soo. In South Korea, criminals of unsolved crimes including murder cases are forgiven/overlooked by law 15 years after the crimes were committed, which means a murder suspect wouldn't be charged or get punished unless the suspect is caught within 15 years after the murder. This is why Oh Dae-Soo was released 15 years after his wife was killed. Thus, he wouldn't be disturbed by the police investigation and Lee Yu-Jin could play with him at his own discretion.Secondly, nobody in the country eats live octopus like the way he ate in the film. It seems to me that the scene shows his uncontrollable anger against the man who he talked with on the phone and didn't say anything about the reasons why he was kept in the prison. If there was a piece of cake or a bowl of rice in front of him, I guess he would probably eat it in the same way he did with the octopus. So, please don't get it wrong that eating something alive is part of Korean culture. It should be understood itself in that extreme context.I saw this film several times with my friends. I didn't quite understand it in the first view but came to like it in the second time and it's one of my favourites now. I like the complicated plot and the shocking ending. As I'm studying translation of English and Korean, most of my classmates and friends are English who spent some time in South Korean and they liked this one the most among other Korean films.I hope my talk helps. 
 In an age of American cinema where our biggest blockbusters are based on films already successful overseas, this is one movie that needs to be seen by more American movie goers. This is the movie that got me hooked on Asian revenge films. Oldboy is an original movie that shows what happens when a man's freedom is taken away and he doesn't know why, or by whom. He is sudden thrust back into society where he must track down the person that took away his freedom. Along the way come multiple plot twist and surprises that you just don't see coming. It's a shame so many American film goers refuse to see foreign films, because this movie is genius. Who knows, maybe someday the movie will get remade for audiences here in the U.S. and the main character will be played by Mel Gibson or Bruce Willis. If you want to stay true to the Asian vision, I even think Jackie Chan could be a candidate. 
 Unbelievable. "Philosophy". "Depth". "Genius". "Masterpiece". People must have seen another "Oldboy" because the one I've seen was a badly written, poorly conceived, over-the-top-acted, sordid piece of "Kraapola" which, even ignoring for a moment the ludicrously violent scenes which makes it unsuitable for the eyes of a child, could barely satisfy the imagination and the thirst for plot consistency of a seven years old.The "depth" of this sorry concoction was exhausted in one little piece of wisdom, "Laugh and the whole world will laugh with you, weep and you'll find yourself alone", the type of boring fortune cookie saying which a great author, be him Shakespeare or, more to the point of IMDb, Kurosawa, would have thrown in the garbage can with no second thoughts. Where this movie should have landed too, if we wouldn't live in an era in which the cheaply shocking and the perversely disgusting are confused with what used to be named once "great art". In short, yuck.2 out of 100. It's not 1 out of 1000 only because of some occasionally expert camera-work. In no way enough to save this infantile failure from worthlessness, though. 
 ***minor spoilers**I have to laugh when I see some people calling this a work of genius. The characters are cardboard set pieces in the sandbox of a weak writer. "Hypnosis" is frequently used as a device to cause the main characters to act sans mental phenomena. (hypnosis or memory don't work at all like the way suggested, the movie versions of these concepts are deus ex machina only with a different label) There is room in a narrative of control for character development but there is little conflict between man and that environment in this story, only slightly above average fight scenes that are unconvincing. (it's a comic book universe where one man takes on 30 or 50 or however many people at once because he was training by shadow boxing in an earlier scene)There is a reference to "The Count of Monte Cristo" (or rather an acknowledgement of borrowing from that tradition), and there are obvious parallels, for example the protagonist in this learns from watching TV for 15 years, the Count of Monte Cristo books and a wise prison companion. They've essentially added one big twist to that basic story but the only way to make it work drains it of character and meaning.Decent acting from Min-sik Choi can't save this one.6.5/10 
 "Oldboy" is at best an average movie, at worst a crashing pretentious bore. Overall, it isn't that execrable, but it's barely remarkable in any way either - if not in poor taste and amateuristic cinematography. However, as a broader cultural phenomenon Oldboy is at least as fascinating as the movie is per se. There is some obscure and, to a certain extent, amusing cult created around this thankfully forgettable thingy. Like a fanatic's mantra, the same meaningless adjectives and superlatives ("the best fight scene ever" etc.) are being ceaselessly thrown at an ignorant audience, as if repeating something untrue ad nauseam would make it true in the end. It doesn't.Among other equally thoughtless thoughts, one can read that those who aren't convinced by this regurgitated piece of ridiculous Hollywoodiana - repackaged as a "worthy" ambassador of Asian cinema (ha-ha!) - would be culturally narrow-minded or unused with subtitles in movies! Oh yeah, the good old-fashioned P.C. One can call American bad movies bad movies, but one should not call horrible foreign movies bad foreign movies.Reality check: it is precisely those with a background in foreign cinema that had any interest in the awfully over-hyped "Oldboy" to begin with. As in those who have already seen hundreds of foreign movies and for whom subtitles are no problem at all. The problem with Oldboy is not its being a foreign movie, but its being a bad movie for any standards, be it subtitled or dubbed, Korean or American, Asian or Western, yin or yang, theatrical edition or director's cut (tongue pun, if any, unintended). There's nothing remotely redeemable about this epitome of mediocrity of a movie, and one should only thank the educated IMDb contributors for the public service they offered in warning audiences about the inextricable mess they were about to be getting into. 
 Fortunately, I haven't seen this film in a movie, big screen, just on a small screen on video. I doubt that I would have been able to sit through the film in a cinema and watch all the violence present in the film. After watching the first 30 minutes, I became both disappointed and curious.Disappointed because of the hard to follow story line, the hardly understandable screens, the huge amount of aggression - I still don't know why I had been shown the Daesu (main character) pulling out raw the teeth of another person, his beastliness on women, him cutting out his tongue. And also curious, to see what will the film say as a conclusion, what is the ending summary of all this brutality.Unfortunately, though the movie was not boring, I didn't get any answer to all these cruelty that I had to watch from the beginning to the end. To my opinion, if you want blood and want to laugh, there is Kill Bill 1-2, if you want blood with more meaning, you can take any recent war movie, and if you want an Eastern movie, there are much better titles out there. Afterwards I will take the ratings from the Cannes film festival with more precaution, as while Oldboy got a lot of praise from the jury, it had not much to say to me and had only 4/10 on my scale.I am hungry to see something beautiful, harmonious, with true feelings and a clear message. 
 Oldboy is one of the most intense movies you will ever see. Breathtaking, brutal and easily one of the best revenge movies ever made. The acting is amazing, especially Choi as the main protagonist Dae-su Oh. All the actors did great but his performance was powerful and emotional (all you need to do is see the infamous squid scene). Chan-wook Park gives this movie a very unique style with his direction. The plot starts off like a fairly standard revenge drama but he slowly makes the movie darker through a series of beautifully shot flashbacks and a huge scene involving nothing but a family photo album.If you can't handle extremely strong violence, torture, sex and language and can't stand subtitles it's best you stay far away from Oldboy....if you can, though, then watch it! It's an incredible movie with some of the best performances, a moving score and a disturbing but unique plot with twist after twist.5/5 
 This movie was not at all what I expected. I thought I'd be seeing an intriguing mystery, but I was revolted rather than captivated. Eating live animals, impromptu dentistry with a claw hammer, incest, and self-inflicted violence are just a few of the visual atrocities one must watch in Oldboy. Add to that the ending of the movie, which was beyond the pale of perversity, and you have a movie experience you will never forget but wish you could. Overall, I wish I had never seen it and unless you enjoy extreme, gratuitous violence, implausible and deranged story lines that would test the strongest stomach, you should skip it too. Its high rating on this site is inexplicable to me. 
 By Jove, what an unholy mess! Revenge, incestuous love, mechanical games-like fighting, ceaseless and utterly unnecessary violence, some primitive "music" hammering away at the bewildered victims, big "surprises" (which actually tend to be about as "revelatory" as The National Enquirer's headlines). Add some shoddy camera movements pretending to be stylish and creative and you've already impressed the crowds. This movie's totally undeserved popularity powerfully indicates the very low level pop sub-culture has succeeded not only in achieving in the last decades, but also in imposing as dominant taste on an impotent audience. (For by far deeper insights into human sufferance under mental sickness, without "Oldboy"s vulgar excesses, I recommend an older Dutch/French movie, "The Vanishing".) Well, don't believe there's absolutely nothing good to say about this movie. In fact there is. The (in)famous scene in which the hero (is really a "hero", an abject father who sleeps with his daughter and then attempts to obtain forgetfulness rather than redemption?) eats a live octopus benefits greatly from the vivid presence of the best actor in the entire cast: the octopus itself. Too bad the poor beast, having been eaten, couldn't survive its one and only act in order to obtain yet another worthless diploma, for the "best actor", at the Cannes festival. Which festival, by the way, between Moore's propaganda nonsense and this epitome of worthless if somewhat exotic weirdness, became a festival of the vapid and of the ludicrous.Sic transit gloria mundi! 
 Why? That is the main question about this movie. When I watched this movie it didn't yet have its devoted followers. I just wanted to enjoy an Asian movie a friend had recommended. And as I like many Asian movies I had fairly high hopes. As you can tell by my rating of it they were disappointed.Why does this movie have such a high rating? What is there that I am not seeing?It starts with a nice enough premise. A guy imprisoned for 15 years with no idea to the Why? and then, after suddenly being released, trying to find out what he did to deserve it. Well, that could be something! And it could have been. But, at least to me, it seemed the script didn't quite know where to go. Instead the lack of a coherent script is covered up in lots and lots of violence. And it is quite obvious that the violence is only used for shock and awe, which doesn't make a good movie.The two big twists are utter letdowns. The reason for his imprisonment is a joke. They should've gone with complete lack of reason, like in Cube. But as it is, it is just dumb. And then there is this incest theme which also seems to serve no other purpose than to shock people.Maybe I am too old to just watch a movie because it is shocking. I certainly don't think a movie is good just because it is trying very hard to break as many taboos as possible.There is absolutely nothing that sets this movie apart from many other movies. No great achievements in acting, story, script, music, cinematography. Absolutely none. Yet it receives very high ratings. I really don't understand why. 
 While Hollywood is slowly choking to death on clichés and unrealistic budgets, the movie lovers turn their attention to Asia. Especially interesting is Korea's emerging movie industry. Japan has a long tradition of quality horror and anime and China dominates the epics with state-sponsored spectacles. Which place Korea will take we don't know but if Oldboy is any inclination it would be intelligent, disturbing drama-action movies.Oldboy has an extremely intelligent and edgy script, which will make you think and question your morals. It would NEVER be picked up in Hollywood. Even the initial concept of being locked up for 15 years without apparent reason would be deemed to strange for the audience. Thankfully, the Korean producers could see the brilliance of the script and give it a shot. It's budget is some $4 million, which is amazingly well used.Oldboy is very much the child of it's director, Chan-Wook Park, who's name should warrant a lot more fame than it does. The camera-work and pacing is amazing. There are virtually no dull moments. The fighting scenes are used to compliment to movie, not to give a reward after half an hour's boredom.The lead actors are no less amazing. Min-Sik Choi is a perfect anti-hero. Unlike the Western antiheroes, he even has the looks of an everyman, which makes his transformation so much more spectacular. The lead actress is a bit understates in my opinion, but memorable never the less. The best one is by far Ji-Tae Ju, the charismatic villain. He dominates every scene he's in, a sort of Korean Christian Bale American Psycho.Music and choreography is great as well. All the details and the grit makes the movie really come alive. At the end, you are in awe, a rare feeling for a movie. The feeling stays with you for days. Occasionally you will think of the movie and shake your head, unbelieving someone could actually pull it off.So do yourself a favor, watch Oldboy. You will not be disappointed. 
 Please do not blame Korea for this bad movie. I am in Korea (please excuse bad English). It sadden me to see these movies which make Korea look like obsessed with blood and sex. It sadden me even more to see animal killings and hear Americans say that is how Korea is. We do not eat live animals!! So please stop excusing movie for its crime by saying it is the culture! There is scenes with the man eating live animals and non Koreans think it is normal. No it is disgusting to us too. The director is a misfit, sick individual who has obsession with killing and sex with family members. I wish America and France will stop glorifying this bad man who is laughable in his own country. Please watch ANY OTHER movie from Korea, that will give you ideas of how artistic we really are. This movie is rubbish. 
 I don't go to see a lot of movies anymore, despite the fact that when younger I would see easily 5 movies a week, two or three at the movies and the same in rentals.Now, I usually only go to the theaters a few times a year for something special, and when I see an interesting DVD, I just buy it, I don't rent.So, somehow I came across this film when reading things online and noticed a very high Rottentomatoes.com rating. (that should have told me something right there).The "Kafkaesque" description intrigued me. A guy wakes up in a prison, everything is controlled, and literally years go by. He is framed for his wife's murder. Why? At first, the dubbing seemed distracting, a little too "bright", but I got used to it. In fact, right away, you could see a lot of effort when into the camera work for this film, and the music. It was compelling.The story starts to slip when the guy gets out of the prison. First, this guy is hard to look at, just kind of wacky. He refuses to listen to another man (had he just been released too???) and when that man falls to his death, it is done for comic effect. I started thinking, uh oh.Next, he meets a young woman and eats a live octopus. Not clear why. Perhaps a metaphor that those with the power will consume the lives of those that they can dominate. See, I remember film school too.Anyways, the absurdity of why this guy was locked up, and who is really seeking revenge on who are plot details better left unsaid, but are actually quite disgusting. In fact, this movie is nothing like what I thought it would be.I thought there would be a lot of stylized action. Either the director doesn't know how to stage action, or I don't know what. There could have been a great fight sequence at the beginning with the young punks, but the camera just turns away. Later, at the "big fight scene", Oh fights off literally dozens of guys with sticks, armed with only a hammer. There is no fight choreography, no real action, just a slow camera track. Oh is no fighter, but somehow beats up all on-comers, often not really connecting with them but they fall over anyways. At one point he is beaten down but just keeps going in a very odd fashion.At another potential fight sequence, he is simply pushed down by another gangster, and cannot even coordinate standing back up again. By this time, I knew there was not going to be too much action by this guy.This is not an action film. There is plenty of blood and guts, and the "twist ending" comes way before the end of the film. The lead character is so degraded, he begins to degrade himself. And when his ex-best friend laughs at how silly he behaves in his self-degradation, his laughing and attitude makes no connection to what he does to himself in the elevator a few minutes later. If this is all he had to live for, why not lock the guy up again? Here are the problems I have: 1) At some points, Oh can kill 50 people at once; the next scene, one guy can overpower him.2) What's the point of the film? Incest is OK as long as you shut up about it? 3) Why would OH make the choice he did at the end, knowing who the girl is? 4) Doesn't a normal restaurant delivery service question bringing tons of food every day to a building that has rooms and screaming coming from it? 5) Wouldn't you eventually die after being gassed every night? 6) Hypnotism has limited powers, and only on people who WANT to be hypnotized. By now, everyone over the age of 10 knows that, so what was the deal here? 7) I don't buy films where the good guy or the bad guy are in some way omnipotent. Or where a character has to have chosen an exact path from a whole series of variables to arrive at the outcome that the other parties--and the script...are expecting. This was the problem with films such as Arlington Road, Seven, The Game, and dozens of other titles. I believe it is a result of lazy or untalented writing.8) Never, ever go see a movie that Quentin Tarantino recommends!So, if you thought this film might have great action, forget it. Martial arts fighting? No. A decent story? Uh uh. Nice shots of the mountains at the end? Yes. 
 I have been reading comments on IMDb for some time now. An 8.3 average for this movie just plain gets on my nerves. I don't mean to pull one of those "I just signed up for an account so I can post on this movie" bits..... but, i just did. The only theme you will come away with from this movie is that incest does not deserve to be ridiculed.Now, I realize many 'hoity-toity' film people love this movie; nevertheless, it is crap. The thing that REALLY gets to me is the fact that the director expects you to have sympathy for the 'villain' in the movie. If you do have sexual relations with your sister, you should probably be an outcast from society. Just my personal feelings I guess. Yet, I sat through 2 hours of this *expletive* expecting some really deep reasoning behind Dae-Soo's imprisonment.I tend to like a lot of foreign movies, but this is my first encounter with a Korean flick and it has put them last in line in my book. Oh... i feel better already after a little venting. 
 Old Boy is my favourite film. As far as I can see, no amount of superlatives could explain quite how much I love it. After my first viewing, (all on my lonesome) I realised I probably hadn't blinked during its entirety and I could quite possibly have been burgled during its course and been none the wiser, such was the extent to which I found it totally and utterly engrossing. Obviously a review consisting of very little other than me spewing praise would be a fairly dull read which was why I never bothered to review Old Boy until after my second viewing, with my Po'. My father being the eternal sceptic that he is turned out to be an extremely worthy person to watch the film with, and his response to it opened my eyes a little as to why I love it that much.The plot itself is as follows. The protagonist Oh Dae-Su is one day captured and finds himself locked up in a makeshift prison. After a brief spell of anger and spewing hatred for his captors, he resigns himself to his fate, and after 15 years of shadow boxing and suicide attempts he wakes up from a gas induced coma on top of a tower block where he was initially seized. He then proceeds to try and find out who did this and why, and the film basically charts this quest.The first word that springs to mind when thinking about this film has to be graphic. There are certain scenes which will make those of nervous disposition recoil until they are firmly wedged between the back and seat of their sofa, and they are likely to spend much of the film there as violence is frequent. In most of the extreme cases it is simply the implication of violence and the viewer's imagination when left to its own devices like this will cause its own disgust. This hurdle was a huge thing problem for my dad, who considered some of the violence to be gratuitous, which I can somewhat agree with, although certain scenes are completely integral to the plot. The best way I can justify these scenes is simple. It is all about sending a message, and these do just that. If you can cope with this then you will break down the initial barrier the film leaves lying in the way of your enjoyment.Another barrier will be the massive culture shock experienced when viewing the film. This is a Korean language film adapted from a Japanese animé series, so there are obviously large cultural differences to the western world. Some of the images used will require quite some thought to fully understand, and the script on translation does lose some of its flow, as any animé or graphic novel fans will associate with. For my father, this made it hard for him to settle into the flow of the film, and I can identify with this slightly from my early days of watching animé.Many of the themes you will pick up on and the method of direction is very synonymous with Quentin Tarantino. There are devices used in this film which have obviously taken inspiration from Tarantino's works, in particular the Pulp Fiction- esquire use of camera angles, and the famous dotted line sequence. However, Tarantino is himself a huge fan of Old Boy, being its main advocate to win the 2003 Palme d'Or (where it eventually lost out to Fahrenheit 9/11) and has stated Park Chan-Wook as an influence for his directing style on the Kill Bill series, as well as on his later grindhouse works Death Proof and Planet Terror. Chan-Wook takes on a policy of "trust the director", and leaves many questions throughout the film which gives it a somewhat disorientating feel at times. This method of directing can seem quite inaccessible, however all loose ends are tied up very satisfactorily in the enthralling and shocking climax. This is an ending to rival the classic Kaiser Sozé twist in the tail of The Usual Suspects.What really separated and elevates Chan-Wook's work above and beyond Tarantino's however is very simple. Much of Tarantino's work is undertaken as an exercise in direction and film making, and therefore his work can therefore feel shallow. Old Boy however is a film which assesses the deepest corners of the human heart. The middle of three films which make up Chan-Wook's Vengeance Trilogy it is undoubtedly the masterpiece, with a more powerful message than Lady Vengeance and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. This film has power because of the depths to which it explores the flaws and forces the human heart possesses, stronger and more destructive than any wisdom can overcome. The performances of the main cast and most importantly the director to send this message to the viewer leave this film as about as close to perfection as I can see any film getting. 
 Oldboy is set in Korea & starts as a drunken Dae-su Oh (Min-Sik Choi) is bailed out of the police station by his friend only to be abducted, Dae-su wakes up & finds himself in a small room which he will be imprisoned in for the next fifteen years. Dae-su is fed & looked after by his unknown captors but is never allowed out of the room, Dae-su begins to train himself to avenge himself after he gets out which he intends to do by scrapping away the cement from the brickwork with a chopstick. However before Dae-su finishes he is gassed & rendered unconscious, when he wakes up Dae-su finds himself free on the roof of a tall building dressed & all moneyed up. Dae-su instantly sets about trying to find out who imprisoned him, after meeting the pretty Mido (Hye-jeong Kang) the two fall in love & together with her help Dae-su finally finds what he is looking for but the truth comes at a price...This South Korean production was co-written & directed by Chan-wook Park & has gotten any number of glowing reviews (the sort that distributors can pick quotes out & plaster them on the video box) & even won the Grand Prize of the Jury at Cannes while it was also nominated for the Golden Palm so surely Oldboy is a true classic? Well not for me it isn't since as I can't understand why it's so liked & I would go as far as to say I pretty much hated it apart from one or two isolated moments. For a start I couldn't get into the story at all, I just didn't like it as I thought it was slow & boring & while many out there would have you believe Oldboy has the bestest most shocking twist ever I thought it was rather plain & not very well executed either. The ending in which Dae-su goes to the New Zealand Alps to be hypnotised feels tagged on as well almost as if the makers wanted some sort of happy ending. At almost two hours I almost fell asleep I was so bored, the violence is tame & it's the thought of what's happening that I would imagine most people have a problem with rather than what is actually shown. In fact Oldboy has a very low body count of about seven & one mild sex scene, it's really not that graphic or memorable. I didn't warm to any of the character's & while I accept Oldboy has an alright concept & premise it fails to deliver & it's one film that I will never understand why so many people seem to like.Based on a Japanese Manga of the same name Oldboy the film looks alright, there's one or two nice visual moments here although while everyone raves about the hallway fight that takes place in one continuous shot I was pretty unimpressed & thought the fight choreography was quite dull. The actual on-screen gore violence amounts to very little, Dae-su eats a live Octopus which is apparently quite normal in Korea anyway, there are some fight scenes, a severed hand, someones teeth are pulled out & there's a bit of blood at the end.The budget was supposedly around the $4,000,000 mark which is actually a fair bit, filmed in South Korea & New Zealand. The acting looks alright but it's hard to tell when actors are speaking a different language.Oldboy is a film that I found an absolute chore to sit through, I don't mind subtitled films or foreign films or paying attention to the plot as I followed the thing perfectly but I just didn't like any of it & it's as simple & straightforward as that. Apparently the second in director Choi-wook Park's revenge trilogy which also includes Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002) & Lady Vengeance (2005). 
 The first time I saw "Oldboy" I watched it by myself on a rainy evening. When the credits rolled at the end I think I actually stood up and clapped. It's been a long time since I've seen something so original. The film is gripping, it grabs and never lets you go.It starts out with a man who is locked inside this room and doesn't know why and blah blah blah...sounds almost cliché. Read the back of the DVD case for a summary. The last fifteen minutes of "Oldboy" are the most intense fifteen minutes I've seen in any movie. By the end, you are so eager to know what happened to this poor guy and why he has been punished. And the film takes a twist that makes every hair on your arms stand up and it remains satisfying. It's not one of those twists that leaves you scratching your head. It makes sense! A film like "Oldboy" is humbling in that it makes you realize that America is no longer turning out the most cutting-edge stuff. But it's also nice to know that someone out there still has the guts to do a film with no barriers that makes you stand up and flip off guys like Tarantino and go, 'that's what I'm talking about.' 10 out of 10, kids. 
 The first time I watched "Old-boy", I was half-amazed, half-disgusted. I wasn't quite sure how to rate the movie in general. I knew 2 things: 1. From a visual point of view, it's one of the best movies I have ever seen. Cinematography & scenography are nothing short of perfection. 2. I had problems with the plot, some holes in it, and a general feeling of injustice, as crime seemed to be pretty lightweight compared with the punishment.2nd time was a weird situation. A girl I knew tried to get into the film school, and the day before her exam she asked me to supply her with some movies that were interesting visually. 2 films we watched were "Natural Born Killers" and "Old-boy", and, especially the 2nd 1 was a revelation.Knowing the plot, it was easy for me to concentrate on the visual side, and my friend always consumes the movies this way. Results of paying attention to the tiniest of details were stunning. I don't think there's 1 scene in there shot without an idea, without something happening in the background, or without an image responding to the theme of the scene.Don't be a baby crying about violence - camera turns away in key moments. Don't be a smartarse, picking on the shortcomings of the plot - think about Hitchcock or Chaplin and how they gave a flying f... about plot. Appreciate the work of the whole crew, and for best effects watch it a couple of times. It's worth it. 
 ... So some people might argue that this can't possible be the worst movie ever made, and no it's not. I have seen movies with weaker plots, worse acting and so on.So why do I hate this movie über alles? Well, it's basically about a man, who gets kidnapped for many years, and when he comes out, he tries to find out who did it and why, to get revenge. The problem I have with this movie has nothing to do with gore or horror, but***MAJOR SPOILERS STOP READING IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW*** our main character basically gets tricked into having sex with his own daughter, and he wants to cut out his own tongue so his enemy won't tell her, because she didn't know. It is so humiliating as he crawls on his knees like a dog in total submission. And why did he deserve this? Because many years ago, he saw a brother and a sister have a tender moment - in the wrong way. He went on and told some people, and as a result she commits suicide. And viola, it's the brother who put our main character through all this just for that. I have wondered: Maybe I hate this movie so much because I think his punishment is way too harsh. Maybe because I feel this movie doesn't condemn incest, but somehow confuses it with love. Maybe it's because I expected something else.***END OF SPOILERS***Believe me, nobody deserves what happens to our main character in the end, and I'm very serious; you know how some movies just go under your skin and stay there? Well, I felt goddamn dirty after watching this movie, and I REALLY wish I'd never seen it. It stayed with me for days, and some might ask: well, isn't that the purpose of a good movie? The ability to affect us in such ways? Yes, it can be, but this movie not only made me sick, it made me feel violated. 
 The only good thin is that after watching more than 1000 movies and reading IMDb comments, I finally decided to start commenting movies, because the rating of this movie is a big joke and question the entire credibility of IMDb.I have seen movies all of genres and have found good movies in all genres. Mostly I agree with the ratings and I just ordered some 15 movies from local movie seller through web, validating movie scores through IMDb.What a waste of Saturday evening.In short: - The movie is incredibly bad acting. Key character overacts and after 10 minutes we thought that someone must have included wrong Blueray into box. - The story is a big joke, you don't end up caring of characters because you just don't buy the story that is feeded to you - During the movie the only emotions I felt were related to following: a. I laughed because of acting and stupid plot b. I cried of wasting time and money on this crapI feel extremely sorry for people who enjoy this kind of movie. It also makes me concerned, if so many people like this movie, what is the world really like 
 When one of my friends recommended this to me, raving about how well it was filmed, the underlying themes and the general greatness of the film, I obviously expected an amazing, at least entertaining film.The two hours I spent watching this turned out to be a huge disappointing waste of my time.I understand that this movie is meant to be surreal, but even in surreal movies, there is something which anchors it down, even if it is only in the slightest. This movie, on the other hand, felt forced and fake. A lot of the shots were unnecessary and watching it made me think the director was trying to hard to be artistic.The acting was poor, and the relationships between characters were not nearly developed enough. Maybe that's just me missing something that others could see but I hadn't even realised there was any sort of attraction between Dae su and Migo before they started getting at it like rabbits randomly half way through the film. Then again, maybe this film was just bad.I am not against violence in movies, but in this one, almost all of it was just unnecessary. Throughout all the fight scenes I felt myself cringing at how painfully cliché it all was.And the plot? The word laughable comes to mind. I would be amused if I hadn't wasted two hours of my life following this poorly thought out and ridiculous plot. Despite all the movie's flaws, by the end of it, I was expecting something interesting to conclude it. I won't discuss the ending, because I wouldn't want to "spoil" the movie for those who haven't seen it. Just that the metaphor "Be it a rock or a grain of sand, in water they sink as the same." cannot be used as an explanation for everything.This entire movie was made for shock value and shock value only. I just hope sooner or later people will stop being so pretentious and recognise a bad movie for what it is. I've seen many other great Korean films and it depresses me that people have hailed Oldboy as the best. 
 If you've watched a few films off the Saw franchise, you probably know what it is to watch a "torture porn" film with a completely ludicrous, ridiculous story, with a style ripped-off from awful MTV videos. Oldboy is exactly like that, with the difference that the style is actually brilliant and gorgeous beyond words. But what's the use of great cinematography, mood and beautiful imagery when its sole point is to deliver a story like this? I have NEVER seen a story so richly pointless, absurd and unrewarding. Yeah, I can deal with films that make "no sense", that have "no meaning" or things like that; sometimes that's what the director is going for. But the trouble here is that you, as a viewer, is supposed to RELATE to this story, to feel attached to it, as if it could be actually happening. You're intended to connect with the protagonist, or something like that, and that is simply unimaginable. The story is written with the sole purpose of being shocking and disturbing, and that's ALL there is to it. Trust me: the twists and surprises along the way will give you no reward whatsoever, it's just there to shock and disturb you. And if you want to be shocked and disturbed, why not go watch films that address TRULY shocking and disturbing things that are happening around the world, instead of a stupid "torture porn" fantasy of a filmmaker? Yeah, Oldboy is not "torture porn" in the same strict sense as Saw and Hostel, but in the end, that's pretty much what's going on. And actually, it is doubly so: not only the characters are being tortured, but so is the audience. Ignore the hype and leave this Asiatic garbage aside. No, the beautiful cinematography is NOT worth it. 
 This has to be the worst high budget movie ever made. I almost gave it away for free after I saw it. First off the the back of the movie says brutal scenes of torture, so I couldn't wait to see it. Finally th main character was about to pluck this guys teeth out with his hammer than the camera turns away. Every scene of violence in this movie doesn't show. And if your expecting a good story than you might stay interested for about 28 minutes start wondering why you should care anymore. It seems like the director made up the story as they were making the movie cause it had the stupidest plot twist you could think of. Oldboy was supposed to be a serious movie and make you care for the characters but they just made me laugh through the whole movie. This is just a ripoff of any Quinton Tarantino movie. Don't listen to the hype on all those other movie sites.This movie goes right with the other garbage Hollywood puts out these. The cover say its from tartan Asia extreme and there's nothing even close to extreme about it. Oldboy sucks. 
 Some people people have described the South Korean film OLDBOY as challenging . For me the word " challenging " is perhaps most associated as challenging someone to a duel . You see a man walk down the street arm in arm with a woman who is far too good for him so challenge him to a duel . You cross swords literally and kill your opponent where hopefully the woman won't want his death to be in vain so she gives you her heart and soul for all eternity . There can be nothing more romantic than disemboweling or decapitating a man over a hot chick and if you think my way of thinking is grotesque or perverse please watch this film before casting any judgment over my character OLDBOY is hardly original . Its central core revolves around an anti-hero gaining revenge against someone who wronged him . This is a story influenced by the western genre , the French New Wave and New Hollywood but one suspects this type of plot has been going on since before cinema . The protagonist Dae finds himself confined to a prison of sorts for 15 years where he's occasionally gassed by " the gas Russians use on Chechen terrorists " . Would that be the same gas that the Spetnatz used on a Moscow theater that killed a third of the hostages they were trying to save ? Right away you're drawn to an unlikely plot hole where if Dae is getting gassed over a period of 15 years surely his captors would eventually cock up and give him a fatal dose ? The premise of being confined for 15 years might have worked better in a short film if only because we'd either see the reason for it be revealed after 10 , 15 or 20 minutes or have it left totally enigmatic . Unfortunately we have to endure another 90 minutes of nonsense The director Chan Wook Park insists on alienating the audience by introducing concepts such as graphic violence such as Dae performing dental surgery on someone's mouth without him being a qualified dentist , surrealism such as a woman seeing a six foot insect sitting on a tube train and most infamously of all animal cruelty where a live octopus is eaten . Park might deserve some congratulations on staging a fight sequence with Dae and a dozen protagonists that was obviously shot in one take but is so over the top , especially considering Dae has been stuck in a cell for 15 years all credibility vanishes after the first couple of blows The big revelation at the end is to be fair in keeping the rather nauseating tone of the movie - Dae's nemesis is a former schoolmate who had sex with his own sister , got her pregnant and she committed suicide when Dae found out hence the reason for his imprisonment . Some people have complained about the schoolmate appearing 20 years younger than Dae but I suppose the years of solitary confinement have taken a physical toll on Dae . But there again Dae as I said can wipe the floor with a dozen thugs so has the confinement really been bad to him physically ? On top of that why let him out after 15 years ? Why leave him there for eternity or just kill him ? For a film that has a high entry in the top 250 IMDb movies list OLDBOY is bitterly disappointing . Some people will claim because it's so different then it deserves its placing . The fact is there's nothing unique about it . The plot is something Jean Luc Goddard could have come up with decades ago and the graphic violence is an everyday occurrence on the torture porn sub genre . If someone wants something really challenging then just show me your girlfriend and a pair of swords and I'll give a proper challenge 
 I watched this movie because I needed to get my mind off my painful hemorrhoids. Sure enough, I forgot about my roids because I was too busy trying to put my eyeballs back in their sockets after gouging them out with a Big Gulp straw. That's how bad this movie is. I am not kidding. I looked around the theater (after managing to pop my peepers back in) and saw that no less than 64 people were also struggling with their gouged eyeballs. The other 12 had hung themselves with twizzlers. One kid seemed to be enjoying the movie, but he also seemed to be enjoying his booger collection, so maybe the question you must ask yourselves before paying to see this movie is, do you enjoy booger collections? Well, do you? Oh there is another reason to like this movie. If you enjoy watching animals get killed (in real life), then this is the movie for you. But since those kinds of people also enjoy booger collections, I guess the point is redundant. 
 If you look at the awards this title has won, you will see that critics worldwide rated the film very highly when it came out. The story is one that has already been remade by the Americans - a man is imprisoned for 15 years by someone he has never seen, released - given a cellphone and five days to find out why he was imprisoned and identify his captor. Harrowing, excellent acting with the true horror not coming from guns but from a shocking personal realisation at the end of the film. Sadly, as is always the case after a mass murder, the media and the public are looking for an easy solution as to why Cho Seung-Hui murdered American students on a rampage. He was pictured in poses which the press tagged as those struck in OLDBOY but these are used by any soldier, terrorist or nutter. I'm sorry this film has borne the brunt of the backlash - Cho Seung-Hui was mentally ill - this film did not cause him to go mad, he was sick. Back to the movie, this will stick with viewers after watching. I'm glad to have a DVD copy of it. 
 There's a thin line between being theatrical and being just plain forced. Forced acting. Forced takes. Forced plot. Even forced photography. There's people who say "the movie develops that way because it's from Asia" but I don't see any kind of forced elements on Seven Samurai or Sonatine. There's a thin line between being fiction (and every work of art it is, in it's way, fiction) and being just unlikely.In a more personal way, I just don't feel anything with the movie, it doesn't take me anywhere, and I just can't believe in the fictional world it is proposed. It just doesn't feel right, there's something in it or through that just doesn't click. 
 Park Chan-wook has absorbed academic darlings like Tarkovsky, Bergman, Lynch, Godard and Hitchcock like a sponge without really thinking to temper his own artistic voice; the result is very self-serving and gimmicky.This is polished whodunnit mystery fluff that has about ten contrivances for every single good idea. Oh, the bad guy's got a button that will inject poison into his heart and kill him if he presses it? Of course, why not. I don't mind pulp, but I don't want my pulp slicked up, filled with classical music and eye-rolling "magical realism" touches, and generally propped up on a pedestal as if it has Important Statements to make.It's easy to see the appeal: it hits all the marks a "foreign film" (a wholly useless categorization) is supposed to hit, according to the market. It's rife with potential cultural dissonance (there's a lot of "deep meaning" in that octopus scene, you just wouldn't get it!), and it's "artsy", yet violent and shocking (I read somewhere Asian films are supposed to be violent, yeah?). It's a dumb, mediocre film that was in the right place at the right time. 
 From the "Vengeance" trilogy by Pak Chan-wook, Oldboy is probably the best, followed by Sympathy for Lady Vengeance. Simple story, "low budget" and actors you already know from Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. Although I am a fan of Korean movies, when I've heard about this movie and it's plot for the first time, I thought "oh my god, another sponsored-by-tomato-factory movie". I watched it for the first time two years after it was released. And to be honest, I was surprised. Since then, I watched this movie more than ten times and I still find it interesting. To me, Oldboy the best Korean movie ever made. Maybe best Asian movie in the last 20 years.I recommend you to watch this, along with Sympathy for Lady Vengeance and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. You'll be also surprised to find the same actors.10/10 
 I thought this was possibly one of the stupidest, most melodramatic, over hyped movies ever recommended to me. First of all, I'll admit that I don't like the movie Se7en. If you DO like Se7en, then you may like Oldboy. However, I DO like David Fincher. In particular I like his use of still imagery, high contrasting colors, etc. This director borrowed a lot from that. I also like the scenes where the main character is stuck inside a prison for 15 years without explanation. However, when I learned at the end that he was put into the prison because an arch-rival of his wanted to go to an excruciating extent to seek revenge on him for what I thought was the most ridiculous reason, I was so ticked off. First of all, his arch rival dropped his sister off the bridge, okay? She could've lived, but he was being such a drama queen and decided to drop her off the bridge because she was being such a drama queen. And why was she being such a drama queen? Because the main character started a rumor that she slept with his arch-rival (that is, they had incest). So his arch rival killed his sister because he was being a drama queen because she was being a drama queen. And after he did that, he apparently thought it was worth sticking the main character into prison for 15 years and tricking him into sleeping with his daughter. How does the main character react when he finds this out? He apologizes in the most melodramatic way and proceeds to cut his tongue out. Uhmmm... he already slept with his daughter, I don't know why he felt it was worth getting his arch rival's apology so bad that he felt he had to cut his tongue out to get it. Also, they connect the main character eating a live squid with his arch rivals very well thought out plan to get him to sleep with his daughter. That was such a stupid attempt at trying to make everything have meaning within this movie. Why couldn't he have just felt like eating a live squid? I would've liked that better. I felt like the director just wanted to throw a lot of things that he felt were cool all together even though the main storyline is SO STUPID!!! And apparently people liked this SO MUCH that they're making a remake of this movie for the U.S. RARRRR!!! Well, now that I'm done venting my frustrations, I did like everything with the movie until they actually tried to make a pathetic excuse for a plot out of it. I wish there could've been a much better story as to why he was in prison for 15 years because that part was cool. But I just think the director was trying to do things because they were cool, not because it would actually be good when it was all put together. Editing is good. Production is good. Acting is good. I can't remember the music, lol. But I'm not interested in watching it again to critique it. Directing was good. Cinematography was good. But come up with a better plot please. For these reasons I think it deserves a 6/10. I think a less produced movie with more thought put into the storyline would've been WAY better. I'm already used to seeing Hollywood churn out overproduced movies. These things don't impress me. 
 In Park Chan-wook's 'Oldboy' (which won the grand prize at Cannes in 2004 when Tarantino was at the helm), a rough-looking man is held by the cops for some hours after a drunk. A series of relentless jump-cuts show him misbehaving at the police station. Once bailed out, he suddenly disappears in a pour-down rain while his rescuer is in a phone booth. The next we know he's imprisoned in a tiny apartment-like jail cell, and is held there for.fifteen years! Again jump cuts take us through this experience, which includes pumped-in gas while he sleeps, self-tattoos of cross-hatching to remind himself of the years, a journal, a constant TV which is his only companion, imaginary swarms of insects, and personal martial-arts conditioning that includes punching the wall till his knuckles bleed.Once released, having a taste for something other than the pot-stickers he was served all the time in his prison, our man stops at a sushi bar and asks for "something live." He's brought an octopus as big as two fists and he gobbles it -- live -- and passes out. The female sushi chef presiding at this event bonds with the man and they go looking for whoever imprisoned him and try to find out why. I forgot a man who jumps off the roof of the prison building before this: but nobody could keep track of all the hyper-kinetic, dark, grungy contents of 'Oldboy.' It's in Korean, by the way, and if you don't know Korean you may miss a bit of the dialog. It's got those subtitles that fade when the background's light, and they flick by pretty fast too.What is clear is that as somebody taunts him, Oh Dae-Su's just in a larger prison when his captors let him out, and what he does is part of a maniacal scheme to do him far worse harm than mere physical confinement.What's initially endearing about this accomplished but cartoon-like revenge-mystery action film, apart from Choi Min Sik's gonzo performance as Oh Dae-Su, the imprisoned man who turns sushi freak, is its obsessiveness, which Choi's intensity neatly underlines. The troubles begin when you realize that however maniacally determined Oh Dae-Su's pursuit of his tormentor and unraveling of his imprisonment's secrets are, it's all ultimately lost on us because it makes little logical, and even less emotional, sense. Or, where it does make sense, it's patently impossible.Park Chan Wook is a clever and inventive filmmaker who like many of the other 'dark,' 'cool' filmmakers of today has a visual style that outstrips his ability to tell a story. Since you could have said that about The Big Sleep and many still do, it may be that critical head-shaking over 'Oldboy' will seem passé in time and the film will morph into a classic. It's been said already though that Park is pursuing cult status faster than he can keep up with himself.The encrustation of the mechanical upon the living was Bergson's definition of the comic, and by that definition this movie should be a laugh riot. There's both elaborate visual trickery and intense real physicality -- witness Oh Dae-Su's consumption of the octopus. He really bites the thing's head off and chews on the still-writhing tentacles as they nervously coil round his cheek. The martial arts sequences are tricky and complicated; I doubt that the actor is doing all his stunts like Tony Ja in 'Ong-bak: Thai Warrior,' but his physicality is down to earth as he punches out one thug after another. No jumping, just punches and falls. But the images and their sequencing are most artfully manipulated. There's a sex scene, and an erotic scene, and a torture sequence involving dental extractions.How Oh Dae-Su finds people and how people find Oh Dae-Su is pretty confused. There's a vague sense that those tormenting Oh Dae-Su are evil masterminds à la James Bond. They have gangster connections and there's a posh huge penthouse at the end. But our hero seems to have been held in a kind of rent-a-jail cell, and whoever ordered up this treatment was apparently connected with something more mundane than Goldfinger: simply a schoolmate who bears Oh Dae-Su an obscure grudge. When the school enemy appears, if I've got this right, he seems to be a decade or two Oh Dae-Su's junior. Does it matter? Well, cultists of the movie will want to explain everything. But not rest of us, because the people aren't real or specific enough for us to care. Choi Min Sik's a gnarly little dynamo (his wacko behavior fits better here than it did in the artistic biography Chihwaseon) and his nemesis is a tall, cool, godlike personage. That's the point. The contrast is enough.Oldboy has hints of Tarantino and Tarantino's Asian martial arts sources, but although there's a lot of dialog, as far as one can tell the talk is very far from Pulp Fiction's priceless exchanges.You think the idea's unique -- imagine being locked up for fifteen years without explanation -- but then you realize it's not only what happened to Victor Hugo's Jean Valjean, but essentially what happens to a lot of black men in America, only then it isn't the beginning of a hip nightmare film. The imprisonment of black men is the real tale of society's revenge on an undeserving minority, but Oldboy's maniacal and inexplicable personal revenge of one middle class man on another has no social significance; worse yet, it never acquires an emotional one.Director Park Chan Wook is a director to reckon with -- some of Oldboy's sequences are hard to forget -- and he's found a worthy star in Choi Min Sik. But this disturbing, violent movie is clever without being intelligent. 
 Oldboy is one hell of a movie. It is a film that is characterized by surrealism, gritty violence and raw emotion. The theme is about revenge and how it destroys one person. After viewing it, it left me silent for more than five minutes to contemplate on what I have seen. It was simply a masterpiece. It has proved that Koreans are one of the most creative when it comes to cinema. But mind you, this film is not for everyone. Especially for the weak at heart. Aside from revenge, it touches subject on incest as well. Nevertheless, it is a MASTERPIECE.The acting is world-class in this film. Choi Min-sik and Yu Ji-tae were simply amazing as Oh Daesu and Lee Woo-jin respectively. Credit should also be given to Gang Hye-jung as Mido. The characters are given emotional depth that one could sympathize for. They were not simply categorized as either good or evil but they were allowed to feel raw emotion. The direction was also spectacular from Park Chan-wook. And the soundtrack was mesmerizing. This is definitely a must-see especially for people who love another kind of entertainment. I could have given this a 11 out of 10 rating if only I am allowed to. 
 Oldboy is the kind of film that the cinema was invented for. It doesn't patronise or insult it's audience, it keeps the audience on their toes, constantly engaged in suspense, drama and mystery. Watching this film is an emotional roller-coaster. The cinematography is dark, yet breathtaking, the music accompanies all of the drama and action beautiful, in an almost operatic sense. It's graphically violent, but not gratuitously so, the acting is first rate and the plot is intricate, intelligent, filled to the brim with many philosophical and human ideas.It's perfect for multiple viewings, it's a good laugh to watch with your mates, it was desired for the really big screen and the experience of watching OldBoy is unforgettable, right up until the very end. Genre defining, it is Kafka-esquire, it's Hitchcockian, Polaski-esquire and plays out like a modern day Dumas novel, all in one. FIRST RATE. loved it, it is a film that can be classified as just pure cinema. 
 I read the review for "Oldboy" a few years ago and have since read praise about the movie from IMDb posters. Often times movies with that kind of hype tend to fall short and is a major disappointment. I don't know anything about Korean cinema so I had fairly low expectations. I had expected it to be a simplistic revenge film, shot in bad film stock. Well I have to say that I'm glad I was wrong, and even gladder still that I actually watched this film.The basic story is that a man named Oh Dae-Su is kidnapped and held captive for 18 years and then released. He has no idea who or why this is being done to him. While in captivity he readies himself for the day when he gets out and take revenge on those who imprisoned him, and to find out why he was imprisoned. So far it sounds just like any old revenge martial art flick and up to this point it pretty much is, but it's incredibly well crafted. I have to admit I have not paid much attention to Asian martial arts films since Bruce Lee died and maybe I should now. Mainly because this movie doesn't have the jumpy camera work, or bad editing of those old flicks. This movie is a crisply shot as any Scorcese film. That alone elevates this movie to a higher plateau.Once he is released, Oh Dae-Su goes on a quest to find what happened to his family and to find the identity of those who had him captured. During the quest for the bad guys, the movie played out like an old fashioned detective movie. The search wasn't rushed and neither was it boring. I suppose the set up made us want to go on this quest with Oh Dae-Su which sounds like Odysseus, and just as Odysseus went on one incredible quest so did Oh Dae-Su.It's when he finds the man who had him held captive that the movie truly departs from being an average revenge film to something that is extra ordinary and extraordinarily disturbing. It's at this point that I have to say that the less said the better. It's something totally out of the ordinary and something that I think will repulse some viewers, but at the same time one can't help have sympathy for all the characters even the man who ordered Oh's incarceration. The acting in the movie is excellent. I had no idea that Korean cinema has such skillful actors. They all really played their part incredibly well. Min-sik Choi, who played Oh Dae-Su was incredible. He goes through the rigors of being a desperate captive, to being a determined man on a mission. Along the way he runs through the gamut of so much emotion and not once did he hit a false note. Overall I have to say that this movie is incredibly well crafted and as good as everybody say, however I find it a little disturbing so I can't give this movie a ten. But don't let my not giving the film a ten scare you away it's a good, enjoyable film. 
 A man is imprisoned for 15 years and is released; now he must find out why he was imprisoned.The film has some realistic and gritty fight scenes as well as a very strange yet alluring special effects; it is brilliantly done and the lead actor is fantastic at portraying the conflicted individual.The film is a shocking to say the least, the end will have you squirming as the truth is revealed about his lover and how far a vengeful enemy will go to destroy his already chaos filled existence.The fight scene in the long hall is still the main attraction though as he hammers and punches his way through endless numbers of enemies; it is beautifully shot and is definitely a must see. 
 I will start out by saying that Chan-wook Park is a film making genius, maybe Quentin Tarantino of Korea. The plot was original and the character development and cinematography was really well done. This is a revenge story that grips you from beginning to end, especially at the end. This movie is a must see, even if you have a weak stomach go watch it anyways, cause there will be those "thats f***** up" moments, the fight scenes are few but realistic. I am not going to ruin anything about this movie or give away the pot, all I can say is just watch the damn movie. Korean film making at it's best.9.2/10 
 This is my all time favorite movie, though most critics will never agree.There are enough summaries on this movie for you to read so I'll just skip to the parts that I love about this movie.It's gritty and personal, an emotional roller coaster if you will. The fact that so many people are posting about how disturbed they were after watching this movie is proof of how powerful it is. Yes, there are points in this movie that are disgusting, but never in the exploitative manner which dominates torture porn. The most violent sequences are off screen, all the disgust is in your head (something that only talented directors can pull off).The soundtrack is amazing. Editing is amazing. You don't ever notice camera angle switches, and cuts from scene to scene are seamless.Acting is amazing. The story is amazing. Some people say that it's unrealistic, but it really just depends on how much you're willing to suspend disbelief. I didn't feel like it was particularly hard to accept, especially after I got into the movie. Plus, the story is written in such poetic symmetry that it justifies anything that people might say is "ridiculous".Honestly, I just wish I could watch this movie for the first time again. It's really an amazing experience.Oldboy is thought-provoking and visceral at the same time. The emotional spectrum of the movie is as wide as movies get. It's entertaining, yet shows mastery in the art of film. 
 Unfortunately, not being a native speaker, I cannot comment as profoundly on this movie as I would like to. But still, some of the reviews here inflict pain just by reading.I, personally, primarily appreciate the film because of its aesthetic value. The camera perspective, color, and musical underlining are in fact brilliant, as is most of the acting; but this is a question of taste and not to be part of a rating.What actually seems to be widely misunderstood is the "story" or "meaning" of this film. Actually, the point IS that there is none; that the main character is both almighty and powerless; that both violence and appeasement lead to nothing; that all characters are one-dimensional and completely determined by their surroundings; that every twist of plot seems to come out of nowhere. This movie is plain nihilistic - there is no point in trying to change anything, as the ending is already set up by some mysterious force. Complaining about senseless violence and sex scenes is just downright stupid in this context. Life can be perceived to be just like that, and this is the perspective this film wants to offer. If it doesen't correspond with yours, I understand it must be pretty harsh on the viewer.My recommendation: Maybe, reading "La Nausee" by Sartre (or seeing the other two pieces of the trilogy, if you opt for graphical display) will help to understand the this masterpiece. If not, well, whatever. 
 I'm sorry, I can't understand why some of the users on this site shun Oldboy so much.I think this is a brilliant film, and yes it does have artistic and avant garde tendencies. If its not your thing, don't watch it.I, however, think it is a masterpiece. The levels of engagement that the actors are in to create the story is brilliant. People are simply overlooking the fact that incest is a huge tragic flaw. there are brilliant, slightly surreal moments, and I think this is what makes the film.The camera work is something creative, and has moments of paying homage to the comic, and other films.I love it so much so, that I have taken the story into physical theatre and created something new. I have done this to pay tribute to such a phenomenal film.Brilliant, no questions asked... 
 Having just experienced the breathtaking Oldboy, I can only have words of praise. I have always been reticent to write reviews on IMDb but I feel this film was totally worth writing about, so this is my first review In many ways, it reminds me of the also fabulous Fight Club, mainly because of its grittiness, touches of surrealism and fantasy, and thickness of the plot. I had been constantly pushed by my friend to watch Oldboy and he had always insisted on its brilliance. For quite a while, I refused to watch it believing that it would simply be another excessively gory and graphic Asian film, but I was so wrong. I have read many reviews of people criticising it for its violence, and have to admit I am not a fan of gory movies per se. However, I am okay with the occasional gore as long as it is not the main focus of the film. In Oldboy's case, violence is just a small (and necessary) part of a much bigger all. The film takes you away on a roller-coaster ride of human emotions, a brilliant plot, and sheer brilliance. The acting is absolutely superb, from the smallest to the biggest character, and has you believing all along in the storyline. The directing is beautiful, with fantastic and dark photography and a sense of "doom" throughout the film.Even though the plot is at the beginning difficult to grasp, eventually it is just impossible to stop watching as the film draws to its inevitable conclusion. Oh Daesu and his plight are the central themes, but the underlying theme is that of Asian society, its rigidness and the importance of saving face. Also interesting is the director's ambiguous position regarding revenge, which is treated as an analgesic and as something to be avoided both at once. Human endurance in order to achieve goals is also an important part of this film, as Daesu is put through hell and more in order to find out the truth and bring forth his revenge.Even though this is not a film for the light hearted, or for those enjoying light-hearted entertainment, it is however a masterpiece and wonderfully original in a time when films are just looking to sell well at the box office. It is a must see for those who enjoy quality cinema at its best, and as such, fully deserves the highest praise. I have given this film 10 out of 10 and thoroughly encourage everyone to watch it, since it would be a tragedy to miss out on such fabulous film-making. 
 This is an amazing film. I have to say though, if you are American and don't speak Korean, than it is crucial that you watch this with someone who is. I know I wouldn't have been able to understand a lot of the subtleties if it wasn't for my friend having to pause the movie occasionally to tell me what just happened. This is a very disturbing film at times and I probably cringed enough for my liking. I'd have to say that its strongest points were the acting and the script. Every character was utterly believable. Especially the main character, Oh Deseau. I have rarely sympathized for a character in a movie as much as I did for him. 15 years? That's ridiculous. As far as the script goes...wow. It's probably one of the best scripts ever written in the history of film. And the ending is just too much. If you had to compare it to anything else I'd say that it's a lot like Audition meets Seven. I highly recommend this film to anyone with a strong stomach who loves thrillers and surprises. 
 I just saw the movie yesterday. The most disturbing movie I have ever seen. Its a masterpiece but very confusing.Those who cares for the movie will find this movie a brilliant piece of work. I have seen Mr. Park's "cut" part of the movie "Three...Extreme", but I dint know that oldboy is one his work. Its a sad movie after all, destroying a man part by part, a sick game of the character "wo jin" who played the villain here. A sick story of vengeance.After all i nthe end, what daeso want to forget? that he ever met mido? or that he knows mido is his daughter? director ends the movie for viewers open interpretation . When they hug each other at the end daeso act so strange, so here are my questions for all who have seen it, 1. does he wanted to forget mido is his daughter or 2. he wanted to erase every memory about mido? It cant be supported to erase only the secret that she is his daughter, cause even after that they will lead a sick life which cant be acceptable by me. so the decision about the forgetting was so important to me.I cant see it again, it wont get out of head in a month I think. So re-watching the movie for finding answer is not a good idea to me. It will make you sad more. 
 I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a film as much as this one.The key premise is original, which is rare enough by itself, and when you add to that some good writing you get a great film.There are some deliberately hammed up comic moments to lighten the mostly very dark mood of the film and these are genuinely very funny.The action is often over the top, but not in a gory way, and it is interesting to watch the story unfold with the viewer having no more idea of what is happening and why than the protagonist.The pace is quick enough that you never get bored and the ending is dark and nasty and twisted and surprising.There is nothing bad I can say about the film. 
 Oldboy is what you can call a sick master piece of the south Koreans. The Film is very well plotted and the direction is excellent. This is one of the films that should never be allowed by Hollywood,Bollywood to remake. It is an original.This is Asian cinema at its best.In the realm of revenge thrillers, you'd be hard pressed to find more ultra-violent vengeance and psycho thrills than in the creepy story of Oldboy. Do watch the film and do not be offended by it,look at the greater aspect of the movie and enjoy it.Oldboy deserves to be watched and appreciated. 
 This movie is actually about Woo-Jin's revenge not Dae-Su's because Dae-Su did absolutely nothing (post-imprisonment) to hurt the guy who had so wronged him. I mean, he knocked around a couple of his henchmen but Woo-Jin obviously didn't care because he blew his own bodyguards head off just because he couldn't hear him. If you are going to make a movie about revenge, the protagonist should have a better reason than some kid spreading a rumour about your incestuous affair. Plus, what was that bullshit about her getting pregnant because she believed in a rumour? I suppose there were no pregnancy tests or doctors in that day and age. To add insult to injury, the hypnotist in the end tells Dae-Su that he doesn't deserve her help except that even beasts deserve to live. How can she rationalize helping Woo-Jin and not Dae-Su. I'm surprised he didn't try to have her killed for the part she played in his predicament. Plus, wiping Dae-Su's memory while leaving his daughter's memory intact just allows him to fall in love all over again without the burden of guilt. Kinda makes his tongue-cutting sacrifice seem pointless if you ask me. I've heard a lot about this movie and it has such a high rating that I expected a lot more from it. 
 Sometimes in life, one can face awful situations than death. Here in oldboy, we witness a situation like this..I heard many people saying about Korean pictures, watched sm of it, and i can honestly say, dis korean stuff, is truly amazing, we could be thrown into shadows of sadness for many hours even after watchn d film. This is rare, very rare, for a man like man to remain sad aft watchin a movie, so wht will be d condition of others? I can't even imagine that..Truly painful, but brilliantly twisted story, it is d best twisted film i hv ever seen.. 
 i don't understand all the fuss about this movie..i just watched it because of the high rating..it's a good movie but relax people it has major flaws...what i didn't liked : hypnosis doesn't works that way guys...and the biggest bullshit ever,HOW ON EARTH HE DIDN'T REMEMBERED HIS DAUGHTER OR HIS DAUGHTER REMEMBERED HIM..?? i have returned to my homeland after 17 years and still remembered every person and i left as a 5 year old kid....and also Dae-Su and Woo-jinLee seem to have like 15-20 years age difference how come they were classmates..?? i know prison can make you look older but i don't think that much...last thing,Woo-jin Lee looks like a maximum of 30 year old guy so it took him 15 years of Dae-su prison and i would assume that after the school it took Dae-su about 5 years to make a family...so to sum up Woo-jin must have been like 5-10 years old when he made out with his sister and Dae-su would be a 15-20 years old guy going in primary school....major flaws guys 
 We watch movies to have emotions, right? Then be warned: watching Oldboy, you'll feel nothing but disappointment! The plot is so weak that they used violence and torture scenes to keep us awake. If they manage to keep you for two hours watching this cause you're curious about the reason why the main character was kidnapped in the first place, then be prepared to be sorry for yourself and for the time you wasted. The director obviously realized that he got the poorest plot of the history of the cinema and he tries to apologies by giving us again some stupidly violent scenes...Unfortunately it does not make it more watchable! 
 I cannot believe I wasted even 20 minutes on this load of ****. It's like watching Fox News. Some of us have the perspicacity to shut the thing off before it infects our souls. Others, unfortunately, are mesmerized by its gruesome, lascivious, childish appeal and end up spending a few hours sucked in.It has a stupid story with stupid violence, stupid sex, stupid animal cruelty, stupid pedophilia, stupid incest, and a few other stupid things. The only thing missing was a bunch of car commercials, and truly it WOULD be Fox News.I am disheartened that Korea is sinking to the level of America's worst traits. Instead of pursuing their own rich culture and historical tradition of philosophical art, they're trying to imitate the mindless trash that is being broadcast from Hollywood. This film is the pinnacle of that wasted effort. 
 ...why I can't rate it 0/10 (sadly IMDb doesn't give me the choice). It also makes me wonder how anyone would like a movie that has no story. Yes there is no real story there, just a guy who gets imprisoned and monitored for 15 years, just because he happened to see him banging his sister. Wow, we're talking about some twisted minds over here.It's not that I hate violence. Have you seen any movies made by Lars Von Trier? There, violence has a point. Here, it just happens, in order to shock you for no reason whatsoever. No explanation makes sense, especially in the end, where the imprisoned guy learns that "he was programmed to fall asleep" when his daughter touched her, so she could take him home. And that was of course, to make them fall in love with each other. Why didn't he program them to fall in love with each other in the first place? And if anyone (and I mean it - if anyone) says this wasn't done because it would be difficult and so on, I'm gonna bang my head against the wall.Oh, remember what happens in the final scene. THAT guy erases his memory, so he won't remember that the girl is his daughter. After that happens, they meet again, so that the movie tells us they'll fall in love again. This director is probably crazy. Please do not leave him alone in the open. 
 I really do not understand why this movie made it to the top 250. I found it pervert and too hard to watch. I did not like it at all. Incest, violence. It was a very dark and upsetting movie. I saw it 7 years ago so I do not remember the whole thing but I remember how bad the movie was. I did not like the plot, the filming, the actors. Please someone explain me why this movie is thought to be a top one. Plus I saw in my DVD club a movie called Oldboy but with American actors. Did they actually make a remake of this? I totally not recommend. Plus that Korean actor acted as if he was a real sociopath. I do not know whether I should admire this kind of dedication to a role or be afraid. 
 A very obscure Cannes prizewinner with lots of gore and incest and some fairly boring characters doing weirdly improbable things. Essentially a man is imprisoned for fifteen years in what looks like a private prison. On release he vows vengeance, and then discovers the man who had him imprisoned did so in revenge for something he, the first man, had done. Lots of arty camera-work, but nothing to make up for any credibility in the story.What did not come over in translation was how the imprisonment worked: it appeared a private company would imprison people for money, but the mechanics of this stretched credibility. 
 First off, I'm going to confess to seeing the dubbed version and advise anyone wanting to see this movie to try and see the subtitled version. That version wasn't available to me at the time, and I think I would've liked this movie a lot more if it had been, because as it stands, I wasn't that impressed, and I struggled to get through it all. Which is a shame, because it looked like some of the performances were really good. I don't even know why they dub movies these days. It should be against the law or something. I digress.This movie is definitely different, and the benefit of foreign films is that you're almost always going to get something stylistically that's a little different from American films. And from that angle, this was an interesting movie. It's also very cringe inducing and not necessarily meant for the squeamish, but the violence is there for a reason and not entirely unjustified, which is good.The story follows a middle aged guy named Oh-dae-su. Oh-dae-su isn't a bad guy, but he has a knack for trouble and does things like getting drunk and missing his daughter's birthday, so he's not an admirable fellow either, but that's kinda what makes him interesting. Unexpectedly, he gets kidnapped and held prisoner in what looks like a hotel room, except there is an iron door locking him in, and in this room he stays for 15 years until one day he is unexpectedly released. He comes out a changed man, and the rest of the film deals with him seeking revenge on his captors and finding out why he was imprisoned.I was somewhat disappointed, because in the beginning of the film, I was expecting something along the lines of an introspective look at the human condition, and it turned into more of a regular action thriller with choreographed fight sequences and a diabolical plot that aims pretty close to the heart, but is completely far fetched. And contrary to some reviews I've read on this film, I actually found the ending to be slightly predictable. I just couldn't entirely buy into the story.Overall it's pretty well directed but at times in-cohesive with scene changes that give little explanation as to where we are or what's even going on. Perhaps it was intentional to allow the viewer to relate more to the main character's bizarre set of circumstances, but the way the shots are assembled, it feels like the movie was either rushed or uncompleted.And despite good performances all around, some of the casting decisions made no sense to me. For example, one of the major characters is played by an actor who looks about 15 or 20 years too young for his particular role, based on the information we're given about his character. Not a major gripe, but it irritated me throughout the film, and made the movie slightly harder to follow, but not in an intended way.Again, I know I would've liked it more with subtitles, and I may go back and watch the subtitled version at some point for a re-evaluation, but the movie didn't really leave enough of an impression on me to do it any time soon. 
 "Oldboy" (2003) is greatly overrated at 8.4 on IMDb, in my judgment. I'd say it's close to average among current movies. The biggest negative of it is a weak and disappointing story, stretched out to 2 hours. The strengths of it are some good acting and production and set design.This movie has very heavy violence and disturbing images at times. It should not be accessible to children."Oldboy" dwells on a revenge plot. Ji-tae Yu considers that Min-sik Choi has wronged his sister, who committed a suicide in which Yu was actually complicit. Consequently he kidnaps him and holds him captive for 15 years. He hypnotizes him and otherwise manipulates him until his release. Choi then seeks both revenge and an understanding of why he was held captive and released.This movie reflects the age we live in and the dying and decadent culture we are immersed in, which emphasizes the senses, might, egoism, and power and de-emphasizes spirituality, transcendent values, and altruism. Yu exercises almost complete power over Choi, manipulating him almost at will, but Yu is really the guilty one. He's projecting his guilt onto Choi and blaming him.The ending is on the optimistic side, allowing Choi to recover some hope of leading a happier life. However, the extreme and graphic way that the story has led to this outcome suggests that such an outcome is a precarious thing and that enormous pain and suffering are the dominant strain of living.Some reviewers like the movie because of its technique and certain of its shocking scenes. As with some horror movie fans, the more blood, torture and gross scenes that look real, the better. An unrealistic fight scene becomes in and of itself something these viewers see as a plus for the movie. The movie is exploiting this perverse taste, which is part of our age of decadence. The ending in this light is less than fully convincing. The dominant impression the movie leaves is distasteful, of a very twisted man who has gone to extremes. It is as if to say that life is cruel and that any God must therefore be a cruel one. 
 I waited many years to watch Old BoyCall it delayed gratification if you will. I found its darkness and grittiness to be attractive. The hallway scene and fight scenes were mostly satisfying. Oh Dae-Su's toughness was inspirational. It was shot well, the sound was good and the acting was great, especially Min-Sik Choi. AndThis is the most disappointing, frustrating and dissatisfying film I've ever seen.The revelation as to why Oh Dae-Su was imprisoned and his subsequent actions were so illogical that I was enraged.I am convinced that the filmmaker was playing a joke on the viewing publicHa, ha, very funny Mr. Park...Now, I want my money back. 
 *SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS* I don't know why this movie has such high rating . Maybe it's because Quentin Tarantino likes it , so people feel like they have to like it too ? Who knows. I heard rumors that Hollywood wants to make an American remake of this one . Spielberg is supposed to be the director and Will Smith the main star . I can't imagine that , but hey . The whole world is getting crazier with each day , so why not .The movie is based on comic book I haven't heard or read . It's manga , so expect a lot of kung fu fights , shouting and twisted psychology.I treat "Oldboy" as a thriller . When I'm watching a thriller I'm expecting logic . I don't know if the viewers who liked "Oldboy" treat is a some sort of fantasy , but for me it was a total disaster in terms of realism and logic.1) Our hero is a prisoner . He's been locked in a apartment . In the middle of the city . The WHOLE building is a prison , where EVERY apartment is basically a cage. And I thought that when you kidnap somebody you hide him outside of the city limits or something like that 2) Our hero for 15 YEARS EATS THE SAME MEAL for breakfast , lunch and dinner . What about vitamins , proteins and so on ? After a week he would be sick . After a month he would probably die . Yet , he's alive and in good health . Magic , I guess or he's a terminator.3) You can't hypnotize anybody AGAINST HIS WILL . You need the patient to cooperate with the hypnotist.4) You won't learn kung fu if you will be PUNCHING THE WALL WITH ONE FIST FOR 15 YEARS.5) I guess eating live octopus is a deep symbol of something 6) You can rape a woman in the elevator and walk away with no problem . Despite having at least two witness , the police wont be even searching for you.7) The love between our hero and the most important female character is nonexistent , despite what the movie tells us 8) Our hero is in the same age as the villain . They went to the same school , same year , same class . Yet , our hero looks like 40 or 50 years old , while the villain is maximum 30 years old. Judging by the look our hero could be his father ! 9) The sex scene is one of the most awful sex scenes I've ever seen.10) You can defeat army of opponents with no problem , yet when you are angry one guy will defeat you without the problem.11) Who's that woman ? Why she helps the villain in the beginning ? Why she helps the hero in the end ? Does she have personal reasons ? 12) The ending message is beautiful  incest is good as long as nobody knows about it. Brother and sister or father and daughter should LOVE EACH OTHER NOT ONLY EMOTIONALLY , BUT ALSO PSYCHICALLY What is wrong with you people ? What about logic or good taste ? This movie feels like an adaptation of one of those porn fan-fiction that Internet is full of . Incest appeared before in one famous movie from the 70's , but that movie never said it was a good thing ! That's the only "message" I saw . The authors of the comic book , the creators of the movie and the fans of the movie need to be locked in mental hospital.I give it 2/10 , because the music is beautiful. 
 Fortunately for a self-trained action hero your enemies conveniently attack you one at a time while you ignore the effects of a stabbing in the back, in the most comical fight scenes akin to Peter Griffin fighting the giant chicken.An then there's the entire premise of this film: An elaborate revenge scheme 15 years in the making, where the bad guy imprisons a father and then raises his daughter for 15 years before using hypnotism to make the two fall in love. Reminds me of "Have the protocol driod's mind wiped." What a convenient way to cover a ridiculous plot.I feel for the octoped that had to die to make this rubbish. 
 This movie was highly regarded and I was expecting to see something unique and appealing. Unique - yes. Appealing - no.First off, any time a movie contains a scene in it that does not contribute to the plot and is simply there to disgust you (him eating the live Octopus), I write it off as being a cheap flick looking to impress teenagers and young adults who cling to things like that.But what really got me about this movie was the ending. Why oh why did the main character cut his own tongue off and bark like a dog? Was 15 years not enough? Everyone has spread rumors. The guy's sister was a psycho. She killed herself because she was nuts. Not because of the rumor. She was the one having sex with her brother in the first place, so you knew a screw was loose in the first place. She was bound to kill herself, rumor or not. If this movie was made by someone with a brain, the main character would have beat down the incestuous brother after he found out that he was screwing his own daughter due to 15 years of hypnosis ordered by the sister-screwer.The reaction of cutting out his own tongue is a unique one because 99.99999% of people wouldn't have done that in that situation. Most people would have been like, "What is wrong with you, you psychotic sister screwer? You lock me up for 15 years and hypnotize me to screw my own daughter as revenge for a piddly high school rumor? Seriously?" And then you would have beat him down into the ground, pulled out his teeth and thrown him out of the window. It would have been a much better ending to an overdone and overly gory (this is coming from someone who likes Saw movies) movie. I know I'm not the only one to think this because the other people watching the movie with me completely agreed that the main character was stupid for cutting out his tongue and barking like a dog. 
 *****Classic ****Excellent ***Good **Fair *TragicReview:Oldboy is not for everyone. It's pervasive violence, its live octopus eating and it's unimaginary story.The film focuses around a man who's been kidnapped and is imprisoned for 15 years, Oh Dae-Su is released, only to find that he must find his captor in 5 days. Now the story though may seem gripping to start with but once watching this bloated and un-original blood fest it develops into a mash of bitter blood and a forceful film.It's directing is on par of average and by no means the standards of what a South Korean thriller should be. Oldboys acting scenes are paralleled with dull humour and a poorly writtern script.Oldboy is occasionlly presented with thin straw performances that one could only feel shameful about.Verdict:Not for everyone but it's scope and vision isn't clear enough to see further than the grey abyss of fog.*Tragic 
 This movie was one of the longest movie watching experiences of my life. While I like how the director, Chan-wook Park, handled the revenge, the move as a whole was TERRIBLE. Oldboy is only billed at 1 hour and 55 minutes long but it feels like it takes at least 3 and a half hours to tell this story. I will say that the English dubbing was done very well and the movie was easily understandable. I felt that some of the scenes were unnecessarily long and a lot of the dialogue repeated itself. Also, if you have an aversion to annoying voices, then avoid hearing Hye-jeong Kang (she plays Mi-do) speak. If you are looking for a movie to kill time and make you feel morally superior to others, then watch away. If you don't want to watch a movie filled with incest, bad dialogue, unnecessary fight scenes, gross torture scenes and confusing flashbacks, then this is not the movie for you. 
 Dae-Su is a terrible drunkard released on bail from the police station by a friend. After talking to his daughter from a phone booth he disappeared. He was abducted from the street and wakes up in a cell, where he is retrained of his liberty for the next 15 years, he is constantly drugged, human contact is unavoidable, framed up for his wife's murder and provided with only the television as company. And then, suddenly released, he is invited to track down his abductor. At first I thought that I will be watching a revenge movie considering that the main character was imprisoned for 15 years without any legal basis. I was expecting an action film that turned out to be a comedy with the main focus is incest. The incestuous brother main purpose in life is to stalk the main character. The incestuous brother raised the main character's daughter since she was three only to set them up for incestuous sex. The movie is sick. What a waste of your precious time. 
 A film that discusses a vast range of human emotion and moral questions, Oldboy is merely a plot-driven tale of revenge. The film is composed of extremely rich characters of intensely described emotions and personalities played by very apt actors. However, these characters become consumed in a confusing, but well-woven, web of events, flashbacks, and choppy explanations. The depth of these carefully created characters built by Chan-wook Park is hidden by the carefully created story built by the same person.The subject matter is full of potential no matter how it is presented due to its intensity and brooding venture into the human soul. But the viewer is rendered unable to connect with the plight of the characters due to the several twists and delicate plot points. While the story is solid and unfathomably interesting, it severely detracts from what should be the major point of the film: the exploration of the human soul.The filming and production of the piece is beautiful. The director carefully builds his story with perfectly inserted flashbacks and David Lynch-style scenes. The acting by the primary cast conveys the emotions of the characters to a fine point. The writing manages to render dialogue for the film that remains realistic, characterizes, and displays emotion, despite the fantastical situation and many variables. The composition accompanying the film is exceptionally brilliant, mixing classical and modern instrumentals together. The music effectively accentuates the intense emotions portrayed in the movie. Additionally, the filming and design creates a beautiful visual experience. Oldboy is a visual masterpiece, like 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), but all of it detracts from the main purpose and raw emotion of the movie.It's like Memento (2000) on steroids, or Room (2015) with even more intensity. Yet it misses the mark completely. The emotion is felt, and then lost in the confusing whirlwinds of the story. Park throws the viewer into the Land of Oz and is lost wondering where Kansas went. Tears should be shed for the tragedy of Dae-su Oh, but instead tears are wept for the lost potential of this visually perfect, but emotionally incomplete film. 
 This South Korean mystery thriller neo-noir film is like a hammer. It always manage to hit the nail on the head. Directed by Park Chan-wook, and loosely based on the Japanese manga of the same name written by Nobuaki Minegishi and Garon Tsuchiya. Oldboy is the second installment of The Vengeance Trilogy, preceded by 2002's Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and followed by 2005's Sympathy for Lady Vengeance. The film follows the story of a Korean businessman, Oh Dae-su (Min-sik Choi), who is locked in a hotel room for 15 years without knowing the identity of his captor or his captor's motives. When he is finally released, Dae-su finds himself still trapped in a web of lies, conspiracy and violence. With the help of a female Japanese chef named Mi-do (Hye-jeong Kang) and one of his old computer friends, No Joo-hwan (Dae-han Ji), Dae-su must find a way to piece together the scattered clues of who took his life away from him, while cutting down anyone who gets in his path. Without spoiling the movie too much, this film has a lot of twist and turns, that will keep the viewer, interested in the story. The movie is an extreme art-house film, often using tropes taken from previous psychological movies such as 1929's Un Chien Andalou (1929) & 1966's Persona. The film also has several parallels to classic stories such as William Shakespeare's to Titus Andronicus & French author Alexandre Dumas's The Count of Monte Cristo. The most famous one is the Greek myth of Oedipus Rex. Other works, like Ella Wheeler Wilcox's famous poem, "Solitude", played a big part in this film. "The Man of Sorrow" by Belgium painter James Ensor gave the movie, some depth with it looks. Classical music gave the movie, its ears. "The Last Waltz" by Frédéric François Chopin, and the first movement of Vivaldi's "Four Seasons: Winter" are certainly used the best. The rest of the entire soundtrack is a work of genius. Not only does every title clearly applies to the events seen in the film when the track is played, but every track is takes their name after a famous film noir film. The acting is excellent for the most part. Min-sik Choi really put a lot of work, into this film. Not only did, he nailed it, with the emotional side, he trained for six weeks and lost twenty pounds to get in shape for the role of Dae-su, and did most of his own stunt work. If that wasn't extreme, enough, he ate four real life live octopodes as Dae-su in the sushi bar scene. While, it did provoked some controversy abroad. Eating live octopus in Korea is commonplace although it is usually sliced first. I saw nothing wrong with it, as long as he ate all of them. That scene was used, to represent, Dae-su hatred toward his enemies and I think Min-sik Choi capture that. Supporting character, Ji-tae Yu as Woo-jin Lee was great at being sinister, while being realistic. Director Quentin Tarantino was at the screening and was shocked to find himself crying for a character who had been completely despicable for the prior duration of the movie. That's how much, Ji-tae Yu got people to invest in the character. The only weak acting in the film, had to be Hye-jeong Kang as Mi-do. I really didn't like her damsel in distress, manic pixie dream girl role. Still, this was a very powerful film. The movie was shot, superb. Great use of mirrors, as a symbolism of fragmentation of one self. I like how everybody is looking at another person, through a mirror. I like how shots of Woo-jin Lee, show how much omnipotent by wealth, he is. I like how Dae-su is shown as the common man. Getting back at the society, by hammer. It remind me of socialism ideas pitting against that of capitalism. Still, the most well-known shot had to be, the lengthy scene in which Oh Dae-su takes on over a dozen men armed with just a hammer. Given that the scene is nearly 5 minutes long, and is all filmed on one camera, in one take. The fight sequence took three days, worth of attempts to nail it. The violence in this film wasn't as violent, as some critics made it out to be. The torture wasn't too in- depth, as the camera cuts away, when things become way too gory. I found the violent to, pretty tame for a Rated R film. The story matter is indeed shocking. The whole twist toward the end is a gut-wrenching and sick. The movie ends with a gloomy ambiguous ending. While, some people might see this as a fault; I see it as thought provoking. While Dae-su is let out of captivity, he can only free himself, by finding out why he was imprisoned. Dae-su takes on many aspects of an Ubermensch on finding the truth, but ultimately his character has no control of his own fate and plays into his enemies' hands. By the end of the movie he is a very, very broken man. It's a great example of why human decisions are meaningless and choice is an illusion. One of the most important themes of Old Boy is the truth. Sometimes, the truth doesn't set you free. The only thing, that I can see as a fault of the film is how some scenes were very confusing. One of the biggest mistake, you can make, is watching it, with the English dubbing. It's horrible. It doesn't match with the lips on the screen at all. Unfortunately, you will lose a lot of Korean language drastically changed over those fifteen years, with it. You should watch it with English subtitle, instead. This movie help influence a Bollywood remakes in 2005 & an American remake in 2013. Overall: This dark Oedipian tragedy is somewhat enlightening. Drop the hammer, and give this a watch! You will not be disappointed. 
 Tonight I worked out while in front of the TV watching Oldboy. If you've thought of watching it, DON'T - be warned. It was recommended to me by a friend and was ranked in the top 250 movies of all time on IMDb, so I decided it was time to watch it. HOLY CRAP did it leave a bad taste in my mouth. It started amazing, the cinematography and music were incredible, I couldn't turn away (which is why I gave it 3 stars instead of 1)... but it took a VERY DARK and disturbing descent at the end, (mind you, it was pretty dark throughout) and I truly regret having seen it. I wish I'd have read this review first from another IMDb user, it sums it up pretty well: "A good plot twist should leave the viewer going "wow, why didn't I think of that?" not "OMG what kind of sick %#@$% would even begin to think that?" It's a really F#$%ed up story, I didn't see it coming, I wish I hadn't seen it at all. 
 At first I used to be have this personal negative sentiment about Korean movie. Korean people tends to make everything over-dramatic (my experience watching FLU which is so painful to watch). And then the sentiment is slightly lowered when I finished this movie.Briefly, this is a story about a man who has been kidnapped and imprisoned for almost 15 years without any explanation. Suddenly he is released only to find note given by the kidnapper which asking him to find the answer who he/she is, why the reason he was imprisoned and get revenge.A journey to find the answer is begin.Right from the opening scene until the very last scene, there are no room for me to breath. The cinematography is so stylish and the acting was top-notch performance. The story development is well-thought and the twist is brilliant, relentless and merciless. The last 15 minutes is my favorite part in this movie. It satisfies my curiousness. By the end credit rolls you will find yourself speechless by how disturbing yet gorgeous the movie was and how the director intentionally leaving us some unanswered questions. My only concern is that I find some of the last part a bit too cliché and sentimental for my taste but it doesn't material.This is Park Chan-Wook's masterpiece and one of the best Korean movie ever made. You will find many elements like gore, thriller, drama, action blends into one perfectly mixed element. And just like any other revenge themed movie, the same question will arise: "When you had your revenge well, what's left for you?" 
 I don't get why you guys think this is such a great film. It's not inspiring, the plot centers on incest.. I don't get what's so great about this movie. As a revenge film it's not that original, no one sane wants to do their daughter. And the plot wasn't that original, it was just disturbing. Becoming a super hero being locked up in a room for 15 years? It quickly became a quirky action film, about this guy who became bruce lee while being locked up for years. Not that deep or profound a silly film.I don't get the fascination with a foreign film just because it's foreign, but this wasn't that deep, cerebral, it was almost Primal how it played out, violence, mixed with sexual perversions. Nothing that deep. The world itself is already devastated with sexual perversion, violence. This film wasn't that shining, it wasn't a masterpiece. Some parts were literally a soft porn, given the context . This movie would likely get a 6 out of 10, why it has a 8 is beyond me. It's not a masterpiece . I don't see what makes this as good as star wars, or the S -Redemption....This movie is over rated , critically...It's not creative, artistic. The cinematography is more or less average. This movie has nothing really amazing about it. It doesn't have a lot of vision. It's mediocre like most Hollywood films are. We didn't see anything that amazing, and weren't blown away. We thought it was fair, but not a masterpiece. 
 This is not a movie for the faint of heart. But, for those willing to go the extra mile, it will be an unexpected pleasant surprise. If any of the following ring a bell: "Code 46", "Irréversible" or "The Truman Show" you'll get your money's worth with this movie. If by the end of it, you're disappointed that it doesn't give you any higher purpose, tough luck. About the action: a shabby semi-good guy, loaded with TV clichés tries to catch up with a superb villain. Nobody wins or, better said, they both loose. There's no elaborate story line, no claims of realism whatsoever. It's not so much about a gory revenge but more about a dark, sinuous journey for redemption. If this movie teaches you anything, it's no to look for greater-than-life answers in fortune cookies. Or movies, for that matter. 7/10 
 Many people today believe that if you are shocked then its a good movie thus the many positive reviews. However I am not of that school of thought.There is nothing great about incest, abduction, imprisonment and cutting your own tongue off .The only thing I was shocked at was the fact that person who wrote this or directed this garbage hasn't been sectioned under the mental health act of Korea - It really is that bad.The story line is not very good or realistic. I am all for escapism as I love sci-fi, but when a movie is a sick fantasy of a deeply disturbed weirdo that's when I problem with it.Don't waste your time with this rubbish. It you want to be shocked go and watch the news or a documentary on human suffering in the world. 
 I just recently noticed that I have written 99 reviews on IMDb since joining in 2005. And I have decided, in honor of my 100th review, to tackle my favorite film- a Korean release from 2003, directed by the masterful Park Chan-Wook. I am speaking of course, of the controversial and amazingly elegant film "Oldboy."Based loosely upon a Japanese Manga, Chan-Wook's "Oldboy" stars the amazing Choi Min-Sik as Oh Dae-Su, a drunk businessman in Korea. The film opens with his abduction from public, as he is mysteriously placed in a dark, dingy building, where criminals pay to have people held captive. Dae-Su is locked in the hotel-like room, being fed daily and only having a TV to keep him company, for 15 years. One day he learns on a news report that his wife was found murdered, and he later learns that his young daughter was sent to adoptive parents out of the country. Over time, he becomes depressed, angry, and eventually empty. He begins to train himself to fight, plotting to escape and seek vengeance. Then, all of the sudden, he awakens one day to find that he has been set free... given money, a suit and a cellphone. A taunting phone call from the one who ordered his captivity ensures that Dae-Su will stop at nothing to get his revenge.He is joined by Mi-Do (Kang Hye-jeong), a beautiful and feisty young chef and his old friend No Joo-hwan (Ji Dae-Han), whom try to assist him as he solves the mysteries surround why he was imprisoned. He also does eventually encounter the man who ordered his capture- a wealthy businessman who lives in a towering skyscraper named Lee Woo-jin (played by Yoo Ji-tae), though the encounter only raises the stakes- Dae-su cannot kill him, for he will kill himself first to rob Dae-su of his revenge if he tries... And now, Dae-su only has five days to solve the mystery, or else Woo-jin will kill Mi-do, whom Dae-su has began to fall for.The acting is superb, especially from our leads Choi Min-sik and Yoo Ji-tae. Both deliver astounding and detailed performances. Choi Min-sik is sympathetic yet at the same time frightening and unstable... you will root for him while fearing him. And Yoo Ji-tae is incredible as our villain, who is oddly likable and charming despite his cruel and often evil nature, much in the same way Hannibal Lector was in "Silence of the Lambs", and he plays the role with much joy and delight. Both were chilling.Supporting roles were all well-played. Kang Hye-jeong and Ji Dae-han were both phenomenal, and all other secondary characters were well-played. (Particularly funny is Oh Dal-su as "Mr. Park", the nasty little jerk who runs the building where Dae-su was imprisoned. He's the sort of guy who would double-cross his mother for a nickle, and he's a lot of fun to watch.)Park Chan-Wooks direction is what really, truly elevates this film to unknown bounds, though. Chan-Wook has a poetry and a distinctive, sharp visual sense to his camera-work. Everything is perfectly deliberate and perfectly fine-tuned. His choice of colors, textures and patterns also set a marvelous mood. This is one of those films where even if muted, the visual tell the story just as much as the dialog. Everything is perfectly planned out- right down to the wallpaper on the walls and the tiniest prop. (It's even in the making-of.) Chan-Wook's visual sensibility and ability to communicate his ideas with the actors is the closest to perfection as is obtainable. He is truly a master of film.The script is very tight, dare I say, even flawless. It all fits together like an enormous jigsaw puzzle, and each piece is important. The few action sequences are amazing and gritty, the music is perfectly implemented to compliment the story. The many twists and turns the plot takes are breathtaking, and you will leave this film feeling touched and disturbed. It gets under your skin and infects you. You will not forget this movie! This is truly an amazing film. I usually try to find something negative to mention in each of my reviews, but here... I just can't."Oldboy" is a 10 out of 10. It is as close to perfection as a film can get. 
 I saw this movie for the first time on a pay per view channel together with my dad. He thought it was not bad, but I was entranced. The second I got home I bought it (it was one of the first DVD's that I ever bought).I've shown it to over 50 people by now and they all agree on one thing, it has some amazing parts in it. Even people who really didn't like the movie, loved the fight scene in the middle, it has comedy, extreme violence and some good old fighting.This movie is in my top 5 favorites of all time and the only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because after watching it as many times as I have some scenes get a bit boring.This movie has it all, plot twists that would make M. Night Shyamalan confused, action that would make john woo proud, sex scene's that are worthy to be in a porn, and action that should've gotten an Oscar.If you haven't seen it yet, do so now. If you've seen it but didn't get it watch it again. And if you're like me and love it, just watch it for the fun of it again. 
 A classic Korean revenge film developed by the mastermind Chan-wook Park couldn't be any better then what it has become. The movie itself has attributed a rather love it or hate it personality during its introduction to the American public and its rather explicit and disturbing scene for sex. I entirely understand its concept and brutality; it is after all a great homage to film-noir and attempts to break every boundary to become one of the darkest films ever created without being a actual horror.During the 15 year imprisonment scene the character had lost all possible nature of himself as he had been forced to become a animal. Masterbating to dancing women. Writing in his journal on whom would have put him through all this pain. Training in combat by punching the wall. Slowly cutting through the brick to at least just feel the breeze of the outside and the rain trickle over his hand and even attempting to smash his head against glass in attempt to kill himself.All that was once the character had been lost in a spiral of insanity in his solitary confinement. Upon release his character had to regain the ability to live in society. He had to learn new words, he had to learn to laugh, to love, to feel guilt and sorrow and to cry. All this character development to a beautiful soundtrack mixed with classical and techno themes.Only flaw in this movie would have to be the one scene when Oh Dae-su takes the roll of super-man and cleanses the underground of all the scum. That wasn't enough to interrupt the brilliance of the movie. The time he was lying on the ground with a grin on his face before he put the cigarette in his mouth or the time hes walking away laughing after the man has fallen from the roof onto a car.In end this movie will not make you laugh. No it will make you cry on behalf of how we lost the film industry to Korea. Because remember when you laugh, the world laughs with you but when you cry, you cry alone. 
 Let me get this out of the way before I trash this film: I love Park Chan-Wook's work as a director. While I disagree with the masses saying he's is the best director working in our time, I can't deny that he understands how to use a camera very effectively. I really liked one of his other films, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. Also, Min-sik Choi's acting was the only thing that allowed me to take this film seriously . . . for 1/5 of the runtime, that is.Now the bad: The plot is simply the oldest cliché used in cinema/literature. I'll never understand how critics can trash a Hollywood blockbuster for being cliché, then hail movies like Oldboy which are just as unoriginal and clichéd if not even more so. Regardless, Oldboy is flat-out one of the most generic, unoriginal movies ever conceived. *Spoilers* Man is held captive, man seeks revenge, man finds out he had sex with a family member, man's life is over. *End spoilers* Simply put, this plot line has been used in everything from Greek plays to modern melodramatic soap operas and countless movies/books in between. It is so melodramatic and unoriginal when the major reveal happens, I laughed out loud. Does that mean I'm a desensitized freak without emotions as some reviews of this film say about people like me? No. What it means overdone plots make people laugh. The Scary Movie franchise proved that, and Oldboy proved it as well. Why can't people think of something that is truly disturbing instead of just spewing out tried clichés masked with fancy camera-work and classical music? That brings up the issue of blood/gore. Simply put, it isn't there. The director is too timid to even point the camera at the screen when something "gory" happens, as if we're watching a children's movie or something. Maybe we were. Anyway, I've heard Oldboy called the "most brutal movie of all time" and "the most disturbing movie ever" but when I watched it I failed to see ANYTHING even remotely gory or disturbing. All the "gore" is off-screen, and even then the violence level is nothing you haven't seen in PG-13 movies like The Dark Knight or Casino Royale before. Why this even got an R-rating confuses me, much less "the most brutal movie of all time". Seriously, I've seen movies that just make Oldboy look cute on every level when it comes to violence/gore.The other huge glaring, cheesy flaw is the main villain. The majority of his screen time he's showing his bare butt off for the audience in comedic American Pie-style, but I'm supposed to think he's oh-so-evil? When he's wearing clothes, his hair is slicked back like a bad Asian mix of the cheesiest James Bond villain mixed with something out of Austin Powers. He talks like a brain-dead teenager recovering from an acid overdose, and his dialogue is so bad it had me laughing yet again. Seriously, Oldboy had me laughing more than any comedy this year . . .In the end, Oldboy is for those of you who sip fine wine, have no sense of humor, and talk about how boring your lives are at dinner parties. It's for those people who are so stuck up in their own ego they forgot how unoriginal they are, and consequently forgot how unoriginal and boring the "films" (never "movies") they enjoy are.To those people all I can say is this: I like "films" and also like "movies". I like thoughtful dramas that actually say something about the human condition, and I also like pointless action movies that thrill me into a coma. But the thing is, for me to like both "films" and "movies", they have to be original. They have to be something I haven't seen so many times I lost count of the number of times the plot has been used. When something isn't original, it's expendable. If it does exactly what everyone else does, it's forgettable and boring. Before you give Oldboy yet another perfect rating because it "touched" you, maybe you should think about something: wouldn't a movie equally as touching, but at the same time original make you think more? I just wish someone other than me would understand this.Overall: Oldboy is forgettable and cheesy.1/10 
 ...so I can enjoy it again as well. This film is so remarkable. I remember, watching long lists about great thrillers. And Oldboy always marked it's place on those lists. Why? I mean, it is a South- Korean film, with no famous actor, or a director. ( I live in Hungary, Europe, and mainly all we get is western media, which I do not intend to rate right now). So there's this film, I never heard about. Ever. One day in work, we were talking about a topic that does appear in the film (won't spoil it), and a friend of mine asked me some time later, if I have seen Oldboy? I said no, because, why would I have seen it? No one mentioned it, earlier. He did insist me to watch it. I wasn't sure why he mentioned it until (Spoiler) part of the film happened. It was neutral to me, at the beginning. A Korean man locked up in a room for 15 years, without any knowledge why he has been imprisoned. Interesting idea, with quite funny monologues (Hungarian dubbed). He swore revenge on the person, who did this to him. He gets out, eventually, and planning to have his redemption. Gets to meet with a nice girl, who helps him. Also, gets Intel/offer/order from his kidnapper... Now that is fascinating for me. It's images, references for history and myths, the monologues, and the revelation at the end... Wow. THE FILM I WILL NEVER FORGET, unfortunately. Because it made a deep mark on me, and the way I watch films. It is not for everybody, because I'm afraid, not everyone can understand it. I hope for the best. If anyone asks me about a great film, what do you think what do I suggest? 
 Though the film is based on the theme of revenge. This is the best thriller I have watched. I would recommend this movie to everyone who loves to watch the Korean Movies.Though the making was little bit dull the script has got that much power to make up for its making. If you haven't watched this film yet you have missed a gem. 
 While it would have been nice to understand what was being said without reading subtitles the entire time, I still thoroughly enjoyed this film. It has so many great storytelling elements and was entirely unpredictable. These types of films are not common in American cinema so it was a real treat to see.I was blown away by the story-line in this film. It totally rocked me; I had no clue what to expect and it was told in such a masterful way. We need more American films like this. Films that challenge us and force us to get engaged in the story. This film was truly beautiful and horrifying at once. It walked a thin line and it did not stumble. An absolute must-see! 
 Masterpiece, different, shocking, great script, absolutely must be watched ...Uncomfortable, sick, but watching is so enjoyable, with an extraordinary visuality, sickly illusion and a captivating film in one word 
 Inspired by the manga manga, "Oldboy" impresses the West, as it deals with violence and revenge in a surprising way, showing that even the smallest acts have their weight. We see here the story of Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik), a man full of regrets and sins who one day is imprisoned for fifteen years in a room, and when he leaves, he wants revenge, it seems a simple script, Make no mistake, inside this revenge we have several layers, twists, intrigue, suspense, action and of course, a touch of black humor. The photograph of "Oldboy" is very beautiful, all the colors are very defined, Dae- su's room is dazzling and at the same time despairing, the city is lifeless, we have that neon touch in dark scenes, even the same Being present, is an extremely clean photograph, and the soundtrack, well, it is a spectacle to the part, with orchestral musics "Oldboy" is sensational, mixing the violence when orchestrating a beautiful song - as in mechanical orange (7I) - all The times that your theme music plays, you delight and serve perfectly as a counterpoint to what is being shown the screen, and the last technical aspect that I would like to comment, what a fabulous edition, my congratulations. Yoo Ji-tae has a sensational performance, it's that villain that makes us all hate him, that is, he fulfilled his role, Choi Min-sik impresses at times with his expression caricats and scandals, but he lacks a dramatic tone And Kang Hye-Jeong does not have a dramatic or humorous tone, but is beautiful and concentrates all the attention on screen, this is the film that consecrates the career of the great director - the most popular in Western culture - Park Chan-Wook. The film does not contain an explicit moral, quite the contrary, it completely attacks and distorts what we know about morality, and its final message is troubled, loaded with oriental manias, "Oldboy" behaves very well, even in his scenes galletas de Action your trail and beautiful photography. It's a worthwhile movie, and it's the perfect gateway to Korean cinema. 
 As controversial, violent (both physically and emotionally), relevant and unmissable as it has been pitched, Oldboy is one of those rare films that crawls under your skin while you're watching it and even more so once it's finished.Dae-Su is kidnapped and held captive in a hotel bedroom-like prison until his release 15 years later. With absolutely no contact with the outside word, save for a TV set, he embarks on a quest for revenge and answers, while being regularly contacted by his captor teasing him with clues for his identity and the reason why he was held captive. Oldboy is a gut- punching tale of revenge, rage, frustration and anger riddled with mystery and an overabundance of twists and turns that despite borderline far-fetched, delivers an unmeasurable payoff. 
 Old boy is an incredible movie of the genre Thriller-Drama-Police. It is the second film in a saga of three films (preceded by Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and continued by Sympathy for Lady Vengeance) of the great director: Chan - Wook Park. It is a combination of good performances, an excellent soundtrack, an impeccable photograph, etc, which results in a movie to remember, those that remain in our memory. I'ts A thriller that keeps you intrigued the whole movie. You can not stop seeing it. If you are looking for a movie that has revenge, fights, a lot of blood and death, this is what you were looking for. In my opinion, it's one of the best movies I've ever seen 
 I don't know why but this movie will always be my favorite. Maybe because of amazing screenplays, very emotional soundtracks or feeling the high tension in every second. I watched so many movies which includes fight scenes. Some of them were good and some of them were bad but in Oldboy... I guess the best describing word is '' real'' about that fight scenes. Because I felt they were. And that scenes are covering about only 2% of the whole movie. Cinemography, perfect harmony of music and scenes, an amazing story and one of the great plot twists in movie history. I am struggling to find the correct words for this movie because this is a movie not a book. And I may easily say it is a masterpiece... I enjoyed the movie with every second of it. I wish there were more movies like Oldboy.But who knows? Maybe there will be...

 "Revenge is futile" is the theme of Old boy, a South Korean movie directed by Chan-Wook Park with Min-SIk Choi as the lead character of the story. It is a dark, twisted masterpiece of revenge fiction with terrifying plot twists.The story follows Oh Dae-su, as he gets imprisoned for 15 years in a room and is finally released by his captor without any explanation. We are shown the changes brought about in Oh Dae-su over the course of 15 years as he is subjected to routine doses of television, drugs, valium gas and hypnosis. He is suddenly freed after 15 years and we look at a mentally unstable man with vengeance in his heart who sets out to find his captor and kill him. The second part of the movie then follows Oh Dae-su as he tries to find his captor, meeting a beautiful girl (Mido) in the process, and learning the truth about his captivity slowly as he gets closer to his captor. The end is a series of terrifying plot-twists culminating in an intense climax scene. This movie is a piece of revenge fiction and shows us just how messy revenge can be. "Revenge begets revenge and this is where the justice system has to step in." This movie is a study on how horrible and twisted revenge can get and the extents to which vengeful men go to exact revenge on the people they were wronged by. The aftermath of this vengeance-filled story, as we see in the final scene, is tragedy and destruction.I personally love this movie because of the intensity maintained throughout the movie. The direction is top-notch and a few scenes stand out as highlights with brilliant acting, cinematography and compositions. The plot twists are numerous with each one more sinister than the last and keeps you horribly fascinated at the unfolding of events. The psyches of the different characters are studied in detail as their actions unfold and hurtle towards the climax. Overall, I would place this movie above other revenge fiction movies like Kill Bill, Count of Monte Cristo as this movie is darker, with more violence, more destruction and more revenge than the rest of them. A must-watch for sure. 
 If you are not familiar with korean cinema, you should start with Oldboy. It's "a piece of modern day art" that proves that cinema is still worth watching. It start's with Dae-su Oh, played by one of the best actors around ( Min-sik Choi)a drunk man being abducted and held captive by 15 years, without reason or answers he endures his captivity for the 15 years of hell, and one day he is freed and faced to deal with a new world while he plans his revenge on who stole his life.The perfect vengeance movie, action, drama, fight scenes, gore and heart breaking scenes that you would never see in a Hollywood movie.A simple man who has is life stolen by an unknown man with only one question going threw his mind.Why was i stolen 15 years of my life?No words would make this masterpiece justice, so just watch the movie. You will not be disappointed!
