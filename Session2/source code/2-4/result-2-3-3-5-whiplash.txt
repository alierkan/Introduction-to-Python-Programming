 http://switchingreels.com/2014/01/28/sundance-review-whiplash/Ever had a dream of being a great football player? A great dancer? A great singer? A great musician? Our protagonist has a dream of being a great drummer, a drummer that will be remembered forever. Maybe you are still fighting for your dream. Maybe you have given up on greatness. Greatness doesn't come easily, you need to practice at it. Andrew practices until his hands bleed.Andrew (Miles Teller) is 19-year old student at a music conservatory in Manhattan. Terrence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) is a teacher at the conservatory with a ruthlessly brutal teaching style. After picking Andrew to play in the school band, he pushes Andrew to his limits in order to realize his full potential, at the risk of his humanity.I had a billiards teacher at one point in my life, who was close to becoming a pro in his craft but a grease fire accident changed all that. His perspective changed, to paraphrase, he realized he was becoming an asshole. He became a teacher of pool instead of becoming a pro player. Through him, I can understand what Terrence Fletcher was trying to instill into Andrew. My teacher would push me a little bit. When he gave me opportunities to show him up, "run the table now," he would tell me, I failed. It's embarrassing when that happens but it's also a learning tool because more work needs to be done. You can't get by on talent alone but it certainly helps. On the other side of it, I saw a little bit of my teacher in Andrew. Losing who you are to perfect something you love. Good thing my teacher realized before it was too late.I lost myself in the story. It had something to say about not settling and asking more of yourself. Two fantastic performances from Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons. Perhaps it will push you to maybe pick up that guitar again, put on your ballet shoes, or hit the gym to bulk up. Whiplash is an incredibly powerful film. And after the final shot cuts to black, the film will stick with you for days.My expectations: Medium. I did not expect the film to be so powerful for me. Expectations exceeded.Recommendation: Cinema lovers and casual movie goers, I believe will enjoy this film.Re-watch value: I can watch this film again and I actually can't wait until it hits distribution.Memorable: I am still thinking about this film. 
 Taking the festival circuit by storm since its Sundance premiere in January, Whiplash is starting to feel like the underdog that could go far with its crowd-pleasing intensity. On the surface, it's a gritty story about a brutal student-mentor relationship that oversteps boundaries. Underneath, it's a piercing examination of the psyche of unbridled ambition. Whiplash is a film that stops at nothing. As a result, it's the best film I've seen in years, and I say that without hesitation. This is a film that resonates on every single level and every moment counts. If writer/director Damien Chazelle was striving for greatness as much as his protagonist, then he has achieved it. Miles Teller, who's been steadily growing on me since The Spectacular Now, stars as Andrew Neyman, a 19-year-old aspiring jazz drummer who's pushed and inspired by the abuse and aspirations of his school band leader Fletcher, played by the ferocious J.K. Simmons like we've never seen him before. Chazelle has described the film as an origin story to the jazz musicians of the golden age, and it thrives on the myths of jazz heroes such as Charlie Parker. They're urgently looking for the next Parker, in search of perfection. But with that comes a great irony. The music genre is known as one for freedom of expression but here the jazz is soulless and mechanical, and that clouds the ethical judgment of the characters. Even so, Fletcher is a man who can tell if you have the right tempo within a bar. Although most of the audience for the film may not know much about music including myself, you get a feel for what he's looking for and when someone's wrong even if you don't know why. Simmons is as good as they say he is. He's a force of nature, with a terrifying presence that incites the fear Bryan Cranston achieved with the peak of his Walter White. But it's not a one-note performance. Simmons is still subversive with moments of weakness, insecurity, approachability, and he also sometimes brings in the lightness he's known for in other roles with Jason Reitman, exec producer here. Even though he's an unlikeable character with nothing nice to say, he's still somewhat endearing and enigmatic, much like R. Lee Ermey's drill sergeant in Full Metal Jacket. This demasculinisation through a barrage of insults is a theme explored in Whiplash and it argues whether it's a crime or an 'ends justifying the means' factor of life. It's not just a music film, but also one that adapts to the elements of sports training, war at boot camp and biopic genres with the way it frames its elements. Fletcher is representative of the devil on our shoulders that yells at us that we're not good enough and that symbolic idea resonates deeply for me. His poisonous words are more a part of Andrew's psyche than legitimate coaching techniques. What grabs me about the film is its discussion on artistic perfection, and especially in these intimate and rough sequences of practicing. What is objectively great in art? When is it good enough, and why? It toes a fascinating line. That's why drumming is such an interesting choice for the film to explore because it's so instinctive. Drummers have to make decisions within a fraction of a second and talent can only take you so far. The roaring beat in Whiplash puts your heart in your throat. Teller's performance as Andrew is terrific, one to match Simmons. Chazelle is committed on expressing the physicality of drumming and Teller captures it exhaustively without feeling contrived. It's the virtuosity of the writing that allows us into Andrew's head however. It's a long road to the top, but the script makes the right decision to allow him to revel in the little moments of success, but then to immediately test him in surprising and involving ways. Each turn of the story shapes his expectations and ambitions and then escalates it to the right point. While the film is a gripping experience nonetheless, in retrospect perhaps it is too bitingly cynical. It does suggest that you have to be deprived of a meaningful relationship to achieve your goals. It does appear to be very anti-positive reinforcement, but perhaps it's merely a statement on the abundant sheltering that the latest generation is enduring. Whiplash is refreshing to see, we all know we wouldn't be resilient enough to take that kind of punishment so it's cathartic to watch Andrew go through it all and see how far he'll go. His frustration, regrets, fear and rage with himself cuts to the core of the human condition as he's pushed further and further. The technical aspects of the film help it become so stimulating with dizzying closeups tightly edited together and its the stark orange tinted cinematography. It's thoroughly impressive that the film was shot in only 19 days for them to get shots so immaculately timed and performed with all those complicated movements. There's a refreshing brevity to the film with its sharp atmosphere, but it's so rich in emotion, psychological tension and personal subtext. It neither rushes nor drags, on paper nor on screen. It really is a film that lingers in your mind for days, nagging you, like Fletcher over your shoulder. Maybe it'll continue to linger for weeks. I hope so too, especially for Oscar voters. It seems that J.K. Simmons is building momentum to be a lock for Best Supporting Actor at this point. However, Whiplash isn't just a best of year film, nor best of decade. It approaches best of all-time worthy with its identifiable themes of meticulous work ethics, fulfilling aspirations, resilience of the soul, and knowing when to no longer measure yourself to your mentor. I'll take this film with me for a while as a screaming motivator.10/10. Best film of the decade.Read more @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com/) 
 After seeing Damien Chazelle's Whiplash - a film the young up-and- coming director wished to do for some time now - being so beautifully realized and brought to life by everyone involved in the project, I was glad and relieved, mainly because I have seen the short film, which was pretty incredible.I believe that among the most telling facts about a film's fortunes and qualities, is the ability to broaden it's public, but in the same time not forgetting that cinema is not all about commercial success and mass audiences.Or with other words - a film that is not just eye candy and booms and explosions, but also craft, soul, dedication and wits.Those are some of the things not only the film itself possesses, but the people behind it have in abundance as well.The upcoming Miles Teller plays the young and dedicated student Andrew Nieman, who has the drive, the ambition to succeed and to be great, which is fine, as long as it doesn't derail your personal life.A lesson the young drummer learns the hard way.Blind ambition is the thing, that can describe our anti-hero of sorts, Terrence Fletcher a.k.a the brilliant J.K. Simmons, who has a thing for mindeffin' his students to the point of total physical and mental exhaustion and even depression.But he does it for a reason, for the sole purpose of finding the next big, even great, thing in jazz and in music as a whole.The next prodigy, the next "Yardbird" Charlie Parker that will be otherwise lost, if not being pushed to the very limit.And boy, does J.K. Simmons nails it.Chazelle has done a masterful job in casting the two leads in Teller and Simmons.Their respective acts are full of purpose, full of tension and ultimately terrific.Expect some awards going in the way of "Whiplash" and look out for Simmons in the Oscars shortlist, that's how good he is in it.And in his own words: "What a shame we wrapped it up in only 19 days".It must have been really fun playing a part like Terrence Fletcher and Simmons completely sold it.As I said, the best movies are those, that reach out to the most diverse and wide spectrum of audiences, not those, who can connect to a massive number of people, who are representatives of only one specific audience type.And Chazelle has achieved just that with "Whiplash" - a precise, tension-building film, full of beautifully staged pieces and above all else, a love towards music and the challenges it often represents if you want to get to the very top.The film ended in a big round of applause from the packed theater and I am sure that will be the case a long time from now!My grade: 9/10 
 There is so many excellent great things to say about this film. To start off I will say it may be slow and to different for some to enjoy and so that I warn you. Now I will say that I can not express the idea enough of how surprising this film is. Jk Simmons does an outstanding performance as the highly unpredictable hair trigger tempered teacher Fletcher, Miles Teller an actor who I've only seen in mediocre comedies also shines in a breakthrough performance as the ambitious drummer Andrew. The performance are outstanding and that's just the tip of the iceberg.My favorite thing about this film is how it has created it's own one of a kind spot in the music genre of film, it's atmosphere is unlike any other as well. The idea that this film is one of a kind can't be stressed enough, I guarantee you cannot find another film out there like this. This film expresses a shockingly high intensity for a music film. I believe that Jk Simmons acting is what fueled a lot of the intensity. When you watch this film even though it's pace will seem slow to most it's intensity is impossible to miss. I can see how a lot of certain people may find this film hard to enjoy but for me this film as slow as it is couldn't have been more intense. The mere fact that a music film shows some strong intensity like this one did is mind blowing to me. I don't know how many of you had this same experience or something similar then you already know what I'm talking about. I have a good feeling and I'm hopeful this film rakes in some acting Oscars because this film deserves at least one. I haven't read anything on this films page and I'm sure others have expressed similar opinions and all I can say is listen and trust me. I'm praying you enjoy this film and experience it's one of a kind intensity just as I did. Thanks for reading my review and enjoy. 
 I saw this about 24 hours ago at the Best of Fest for Sundance, and this last 24 hours I have done little but think about and marvel at this film. I really had zero expectations going in, I heard the buzz surrounding it in town, but knew very little about it as the film began. I have yet to get the words that do my thoughts justice for this movie but I am going to try. First everything about this film was stellar; casting, writing, acting, directing, music and cinematography all came together to just tell an incredible story. I want to say a bit more about a couple of these aspects. Acting, first of all I don't know who impressed me more Miles Teller in the lead as Andrew Nieman or JK Simmons playing Band teacher Terence Fletcher. Both did so great that had either been a lesser actor they would have been out shined by the other. Simmons' performance really reminded me of Gunnery Sargent Hartman from Full Metal Jacket, except rather than emotionally destroying and rebuilding marines he was doing it to 18 year old kids. His character could have easily been cartoony and 2 dimensional but Simmons gave him such depth that the whole film I felt compassion for and even understood his motives, even before he lays them out for Nieman in the third act. Two scenes bring you to the core of this character and the line that has intrigued me for 24 hours is "No words in the English language are more dangerous than 'good job.'" (thus why I titled my review as such, sorry I couldn't resist). Then on to Teller's performance, for a younger actor who I haven't seen in much I must say he played his role like a seasoned actor. His performance just wrapped me up and to find out he did much of the drumming himself is insane. Whilst watching some of the intense scenes I felt like I was watching him be executed, and other times it feels like the fight in Rocky, you feel like you are just watching him get demolished, except all of this is emotional rather than the easier physical. Whether it is the discouragement, the socially awkwardness, the single parent household, the internal conflict, the hubris, the arrogance, and at times the mental torture that he put himself through, all just blew me away. Teller reminded me of a much much more talented John Cusack and had the charisma and electricity to connect to the audience. The one other thing I must commend is the writing, so often you kind of know where a movie is headed but this movie stayed very unpredictable and just when you think for certain how a scene or sequence of scenes will play out they take a hard left and keeps you off balance (in a good way). It was so refreshing, a few times I thought the bow was on the film but then something disrupts how "it should go or end". Sorry if I rambled, perhaps after thinking on it more I can get a more focused review, needless to say this film is a must-see when it gets a broad release. Great job to all involved and congrats on winning the award at Sundance, you certainly earned it. One last thing if this gets attention in wide release this could see a heightened interest in Jazz, this is certainly a film that can make even the not-so musically inclined want to throw on a Jazz record and just drown in it. 
 The good parts:The movie is very sensitively filmed. The camera relentlessly explores every bump on Teller's and Simmons's heads like a documentary about Greek sculpture. It adds a lot to the feel of the movie in a wonderfully subtle way.Simmons and Teller (as the "Studio" band director and the, I guess, protagonist young drummer) do a great job. Simmons in particular is really the nexus of energy for the entire movie, and owns that role with absolute precision.The music, when it's actually music, is well-chosen and well-performed.The terrible parts:Simmons ("Fletcher") and Teller ("Andrew") are essentially the only characters in the film. Andrew's dad and his not-really girlfriend are secondary characters that serve to remind the audience what actual humans are like. Andrew is an insufferable jerk, and Teller does an amazing job of maintaining (mostly) a stone-faced, blankly insensitive look throughout almost every tense moment of the film. Simmons's Fletcher is a superb sadistic maniac. He's not "intense" or "volatile" - he's a psychotic monster.I'm debilitated as a reviewer because my son is a talented young drummer, so I get to see good drumming all the time. The persistent trope in the film of Andrew drumming until his hands bleed is wildly unrealistic; that basically cannot happen if you're a drummer good enough to get into a prestigious music school in the first place. Everything else about Andrew at the fancy school, upon further examination, is completely unreal. He basically never talks to the other complete non-entities in the band. They're all like POWs, obeying the maniac director unflinchingly (except when they fail, when they're abused and ejected). My son (whose judgment I trust because he's also obsessed, but not a jerk) described the silly drum "competition" as "three people who can't drum doing shitty grind-core break beats". (To be fair, he liked the movie. What can you do.)So OK, the movie is an allegory, and not intended to be realistic. So it's an allegory about how a sadist can really help a self-absorbed jerk with some obsession get better at what they want to do? I can't find any way to sympathize with that. I mean, who is that speaking to?Finally, the actually appropriate and yet irritatingly obtrusive product placement (pristine cymbal labels, super-clean Zildjian logo on Andrew's stick bag, etc) got pretty hard to take by the (truly weird) ending.Go see this movie because everybody else thinks it's great, but if you feel funny afterwards maybe this review will offer some comfort that you're not alone. 
 An unknown title, by an unknown director, starring an unknown lead, what does that form? Only one of the best damn dramas of this century to date. Inspiring, intense, reverent, Damien Chazelle's jazz-infused drama is an incredibly complex character study that has newcomer Miles Teller and veteran J.K. Simmons at the top of their game in this brilliant effort, 'Whiplash' is arguably the most riveting and sensational drama from 2014.J.K. Simmons stars as antihero Terence Fletcher, a character we look at as the opportunity of Andrew's success, but also we hate for his brutal portrayal. From his profanity-clad embodiment of evil to the ever-hopeful light at the end of the film, we go through stages of loving, hating and even fearing him, a character who despite his occasional moments of sympathy, cares solely about the outcome of his orchestra, and shuns away anyone who tries to destroy that. Simmons's performance is flawless and breathless, a truly resonant achievement, and one of the most Oscar-deserving performances of recent years.The gold and black colour palette, fast-paced editing, fluent and claustrophobic cinematography - every single component adds a fresh face to 21st century cinema and independent films as a whole, further supporting my conclusion that indie films have overtaken blockbusters for the provision of unique visions and entertainment. Chazelle's effort pays off as he creates not only one of the greatest villains of the 21st century in the form of Fletcher, but also one of the greatest movies of the 21st century, if not of all time, through which he rekindled the dying flame that is jazz.The fusion of emotions throughout make this a film that thrusts the audience into a world of obsession, dedication and confrontation, thus ensuing a tale of inspiration, a man and his dreams of becoming a "somebody", and to conclude, let's just note that final drum solo and sense of rebellion Andrew feels, it is utter gold, truly perfect. This movie is powerful, it is intense, it is unique, it is a stunning masterpiece! 
 This movie was far better than the trailer made it look.JK Simmons gave a stellar performance as a music teacher in the best Jazz school, trying desperately to find and develop the next jazz legend. From the moment he appears he demands the screen, literately. There's a part in the flick were he just burst open the door putting a halt on whatever is going, and makes it all about what he wants, which sets the tone for the entire movie. One of the best antagonist I've seen at the movies.Miles Teller plays the protagonist, A first year Jazz student who wants to be the next Jazz legend and is willing to go through the pain needed to become just that. I've been a fan of Miles Teller for a while and this movie just increase my fandomIt does not matter whether you are into jazz or not, this flick is about and boy willing to kill himself to become the best and the man willing to kill the boy so he can be the best. For anyone who has ever been in that kind of pressure, weather it be at college or on the playing field(I kid you not, watching these guys play Jazz played out like I was watching a Football movie with Miles being the Quarterback and JK being the coach) It was an emotion trill ride with a lot of ups and downs, and just when you think the ride is over, we go for a second time around. Excellence!! 
 When it comes to cinema, there are often little gems in a sea of bigger spectacles, that can break through in the most proficient way. Last year, I pleaded to the entire film universe that discover and understand "Inside Llewyn Davis" from the Coen Brothers after seeing it for the first time at NYFF. This year, I've seem to already come to terms that the next film that will utilize all my energy and resources this year will be Damien Chazelle's highly intense psychological drama "Whiplash." An impeccable and tightly wound experience that brings your anxiety to a feverish level. As small, and utterly different as I'm about to compare, I haven't felt this uneasy with a film's tension since Paul Greengrass' "Captain Phillips," coincidentally also was a NYFF title. Two other similar traits that embody the two are the intense and completely submersible performances that inhabit them. Stars Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons are absolutely astonishing, featuring two of the year's very best turns.Chazelle's film tells the story of Andrew (Teller), a first year music student that seeks out and joins the prestigious school band, headed by an intense and frightening teacher Mr. Fletcher (Simmons).Walking out of the screening I fully knew (though I fully hope to be proved wrong this year) that Miles Teller would be my "Oscar Isaac" this year. A performance that should shoot to the top of any awards consideration for a lead actor, but unfortunately will be passed over show after show. Teller is submerged in a way that we haven't seen the young actor achieve at this stage in his career. After plowing onto the scene opposite Nicole Kidman in "Rabbit Hole," and then helming "The Spectacular Now" with complete ease and intensity, I was not expecting him to be the machine of fury and magnitude that is on display in "Whiplash." There are moments where he channels the emotional aura of performances like Tom Hulce/F. Murray Abraham in "Amadeus," as crazy as that sounds. I am so excited to see where Teller goes from here. It makes the future of film a lot more bright, knowing that someone like him will be rising up in the ranks.Everything you've heard about J.K. Simmons is true and then some. A fully fleshed out supporting role, Chazelle doesn't write Fletcher as a caricature. He's a deeply acute individual, full of passion and acrimony. Chazelle doesn't keep Simmons at a "10," he and Simmons allow him to find a range of empathy, hatred, and cryptic allowances that will keep you at the edge of your seat. As I watched Simmons flesh out a performance that can only be described as magnificent, I kept coming back in my mind to Christoph Waltz in the Oscar-winning "Inglourious Basterds," a role that found much heat on the awards circuit. The world/all film lovers will not be able ignore the stunning presence of Simmons. A Supporting Actor nominations (maybe even a win) seems all but assured (and deserved). Looking back at the veteran actor's career that included memorable roles in "Juno," "Burn After Reading," and "Up in the Air," a role like this could not have come at a better time. Already impressive in his brief work in Jason Reitman's "Men, Women & Children," writers, directors, casting agents, and producers will be pounding on the actor's door.You can't credit "Whiplash" without citing the words and control by writer/director Damien Chazelle. An amazing and outstanding sophomore effort (unfortunately have not seen his debut "Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench") that channels a young Bennett Miller. Vigorous, self-assured, and innovative, Chazelle is a brilliant auteur filmmaker that knows exactly what type of films he wants to make. He takes inspiration from his own life, his love of film and music, and other places I'm sure we don't know about, and molds them into a gritty, layered experience, conditioned with rich characters, all realized through the writer's story. It's one of the best scripts of the year."Whiplash" features some of the best minutes of film seen in 2014. An ending that will bring tears to your eyes, dual performances that will have you applaud, and an experience that you surely will not forget. Drumming has never felt like such a personality. It acts as a visible tool for the viewer to understand and try. If you love music, appreciate education, and dare to be better than your current state, you will find something very real to latch onto. Hold on, and hold on tight."Whiplash" is being distributed by Sony Pictures Classics and will be released October 10 in limited release (and then expanding after). A must-see for all movie lovers! 
 Greetings again from the darkness. The pursuit of greatness is not always pretty. No matter if your dream is athletics, dancing, music or some other; you can be sure hard work and sacrifice will be part of your routine. You will likely have a mentor, teacher or coach whose job is to cultivate your skills while pushing you to new limits. This film questions whether the best approach is intimidation or society's current preferred method of nurturing.Miles Teller plays Andrew, a first year student at an elite Manhattan music conservatory. Andrew dreams of being a great jazz drummer in the vein of Buddy Rich. When offered a rare shot at the top ensemble, Andrew quickly discovers the conductor is a breed unlike anything he has ever encountered. The best movie comparison I can offer for JK Simmons' portrayal of Terence Fletcher is R Lee Ermey's Drill Instructor in Full Metal Jacket. This is no Mr Holland's Opus. Fletcher bullies, intimidates, humiliates and uses every imaginable form of verbal abuse to push his musicians, and especially young Andrew, to reach for greater heights.Andrew and Fletcher go head to head through the entire movie, with Fletcher's mental torment turning this into a psychological thriller ... albeit with tremendous music. We witness Andrew shut out all pieces of a personal life, and even take on some of Fletcher's less desirable traits. Andrew's diner break-up with his girlfriend (Melissa Benoist) is much shorter, but just as cold as the infamous opening scene in The Social Network. At a small dinner party, Andrew loses some of the sweetness he inherited from his dad (Paul Reiser), and unloads some Fletcherisms on some unsuspecting family friends.Writer/Director Damien Chazelle has turned his Sundance award-winning short film into a fascinatingly brutal message movie that begs for discussion and debate. The open-ended approach is brilliant, though I found myself initially upset at the missing clean wrap that Hollywood so often provides. What price greatness? Is comeuppance a reward? Are mentors cruel to be kind? For the past few years, I have been proclaiming that Miles Teller (The Spectacular Now) is the next John Cusack. Perhaps that bar is too low. Teller just gets better with each film. His relentless energy draws us in, and we find ourselves in his corner ... even though this time, he's not the greatest guy himself. Still, as strong as Teller is, the film is owned by JK Simmons. Most think of him as the dad in Juno, or the ever-present insurance spokesman on TV, but he previously flashed his bad side as the white supremacist in "Oz". Even that, doesn't prepare us for Simmons' powerhouse performance ... just enough humanity to heighten his psychological torturing of musicians.You should see this one for Simmons' performance. Or see it for the up and coming Teller. Enjoy the terrific music, especially Duke Ellington's "Caravan". See it for the talking points about teachers, society and personal greatness. See it for any or all these reasons - just don't tell director Damien Chazelle "good job". 
 this is played out as if the young musicians are in boot camp. the head teacher is more vicious drill sergeant than music teacher. anyone who has played an instrument will tell you, yes that practise is hard and you have to be committed, but it is always enjoyable and fulfilling. no one in this film seems to take pleasure in playing music. it is so ludicrous, over the top and ultimately just plain corny. they spell out what the film is about in very childish dialogue as if an audience cannot pick up on what the teacher is trying to do. scene after scene of bombastic emotional and physical brutality. any teacher teaching as this sadist does would not last a week, let alone manage to impart any kind of knowledge into his pupils. then we have the ending the kid races against time, survives a head on car collision and still makes it to the gig, (whereupon the teacher has change what they are going to play just for spite, this is the kind of character he has been throughout this one note film,) and then still manages that old cliché of killing them dead with his boring drum solo. drumming is not about speed its about making melody from skins. Overrated by critics who by now really don't know what makes a good film 
 Whiplash is low budget film making at its finest, and surely promises big things from rookie director/writer Damien Chazelle. Seeing this film in theaters was the first time this year that I have completely enraptured (granted, I have not seen all of the top films that have come out so far). Also, I am a succor for quality films about musicians, and Whiplash ranks in my all time favorites in that genre. The tension did not let up from the very first scene, especially as soon as the incredible J.K. Simmons enters. Simmons, along with Miles Teller (who's Project X days are now long behind him) have some of the best on screen chemistry I've seen. They're connected; one cannot act without it affecting the other. The film is almost entirely focused on this relationship, and the simplicity definitely services the film. I hope people will go and see it and vote with their pocketbooks for excellent low budget films. 
 This movie tries so hard to display the hardships of training to be a musician that the whole image shifts into simple physical and mental abuse of human beings, in this case teenagers. As another reviewer said: it is the boot camp of music. I did not believe what I was seeing. If there was a movie where some dog-whisperer is hitting the dog and yelling at it and this would prove to be working as a method to 'educate' the dog, then people would be upset. But treating a human like that is OK? this just sickens me. yes, you can get humans to do some things by pushing them with violence. Get them into an obedient state of mind, that is simply following orders. But there is a reason why this strategy of motivation has proved to be only effective in the military: There, human lives are indeed worthless. This treatment will make you 'harder', meaning it will make you less of a human being.When it comes to music however it is impossible to achieve great results with these methods. It can only lead to a soul- and heartless disaster. A fitting result would have been an aggression build-up in the main character which would have prevented him from ever playing anything worth listening to again. This reaction has been seen in other movies where usually the people that are socially connected to the main character will have to suffer from the violent state of mind that this mistreatment is causing. The other possibility is a simple resignation, either by quitting music or by quitting life.But what is displayed here is wrong on many levels, because it tells you that this abuse leads to something beautiful. That it is all worth it because it pushes you to your limits and then you will be a great musician. Whoever made up this story is either suffering from a severe psychosis or has the intent to justify abusive methods in education by presenting them as effective.If you treat people with violence they will get violent too. Either towards others or towards themselves. This is the only result you will achieve. And in this case it would also completely destroy the main character's ability to be a musician. Music is not the military. You do need discipline and training, but this comes from mental strength. And you do not get stronger by being abused. It will only weaken you.It makes me sad seeing that apparently this movie is entertaining to people. This can only be the case if they do not see the utter failure in judgment that is presented here. And if they do not see it then they are blind in a way that is worrying. 
 I find it very sad that so many people - including so-called professional reviewers - have rated this crap so highly. I did not walk out (although I was greatly tempted to do so) but saw it to the end. A total waste of time.Here's what might spoil it for you, should you believe the BS that's being spread around this stinking pile of excrement: It could have actually been OK if it hadn't been so laughably impossibly ridiculous. Perhaps if it had been set in the fifties or the forties when people had much less developed consciousness of human rights? But even so... I suppose the moral/lesson we are supposed to learn is... if you can't warp your students enough by abuse to force them to become great musicians then it is perfectly alright to discard or destroy them in the attempt. This glorified tyrant and bully can himself only produce music at a grade one level and so because he cannot 'do' he 'teaches?'He does not teach, he does not inspire; he withholds approval, negatively reinforces and rules by fear, and is feared rather than respected. I would have a difficult time to point to a single (pedagogical) scene in the film that had any merit whatsoever or was worth watching for any reason. Maybe I should say that its evident popularity may be evidence that we are truly living in the end times... ha! See the film if you want to be current, but please decide for yourself from watching it and don't believe the hype about its 'genius' or 'brilliance.' It is not either of those things; it's a poorly written, sad joke. 
 "Music is your own experience, your own thoughts, your wisdom. If you don't live it, it won't come out of your horn. They teach you there's a boundary line to music. But, man, there's no boundary line to art." Charlie Parker sums it all, Cinema is true Art. I wasn't expecting to feel this way after watching this movie. Every moment has tension and something unexpected occurring. It is as if the director had chosen to apply the tempo of the drums to the script. Anyone can relate to this story. We all have pursued a dream, a passion ... Rather or not we made it our everyday job or maybe just a hobby aside, some of us strive for something bigger. This film is a journey in the search of your inner spirit, inner creativity ... not only will it make it clear that you cannot succeed without effort and hard work, it will also make you realize there are two different kinds of artists : - those who make art, - and those who make beautiful art"Beautiful" because they are stimulated by a special strength within, a GIFT. Is it because I reminisce N.Y.C. or that I play the drums? I simply believe the performances were astonishing and the actors perfectly chosen to embody these terrific characters. I won't say "good job" but rather "thank you", to the promising Franco-American director Damien Chazelle﻿ for sharing his vision. 
 I gave it 28 minutes. That was generous, in that I knew it was going to be terrible within about 2.I've been to music school. It's not like this. The teachers aren't like this. No one's like this (obviously I'm referring to 'Hollywood idea of what a hard-ass music teacher might be like in some weird juvenile negative fantasy' Fletcher).I switched off when he threw a chair at Andrew the drum prodigy and then slapped him. SLAPPED him. Repeatedly. In front of a whole, cowed class of what, in legal terms, would be called witnesses to an assault, for playing slightly fast, the first time he's ever played to him in a band practice.I'm sorry, what?! Where does this/would this/has this ever happened? In a Charles Dickens novel about a jazz drum student, possibly. In anything even vaguely purporting to be based on real life now, um...No.I'm stunned. Yet another IMDb/Metacritic/Rotten Tomatoes gush-fest that is so laughably bad, you have to check the page again to really believe it's got such high praise.Excruciating nonsense. 
 My non-musician friends love this film and insisted I see it. I've been a jazz musician for over 30 years and have taught in a jazz university for over 20. So they figured I would relate. Sorry, this is total crap and it makes me sad to think that the average guy out there thinks Kenny G is cool and this film is a hard-edged depiction of the high-pressure jazz school scene. First of all, no prof would be there a day after any of the rehearsals Terence ran, he'd be dismissed immediately (not hard to do, apparently this school didn't have tenure). And next, jazz is communication, conversation, thoughtfulness, and a big dollop of joyful soul. Any drummer with the competitive mean-spirited attitude shown by any of these students would find themselves in extremely lonely company, nobody appreciates that. This is the 21st Century equivalent of Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland saying, "I know, let's build a show to save the town!" as a representation of Show Biz. it's Hollywood hokum, folks, and I resented its basic assumptions. Where is the Soul? That said, J.K. Simmons is great, working with what he's got. And the cinematography and editing are well done (what IS all that water on the cymbals we see so often? Sweat? If Elvin Jones had gained two hundred pounds he wouldn't have sweated like that! Oh well.) which is why I grudgingly added two stars to this. It's been a while since I so disliked a film. P.S. my drummer plays better than any of these guys. Hah! 
 In the 70s, a new genre of films aimed at black audiences emerged entitled, 'Blaxploitation'. The genre primarily glorified stereotypical "criminal" behavior in black neighborhoods. Now with Damien Chazelle's, 'Whiplash', he's invented a new genre primarily for a large coterie of Caucasian males: 'Jazzploitation', set in an elite jazz program at a Julliard-like school of higher musical instruction. Both white liberal film critics and martial arts enthusiasts alike, will enjoy this exercise in sado-masochistic shenanigans as evidenced by the plethora of rave reviews now gracing a multitude of web pages over the internet.Don't ask any of our critics who rave about the film to require Mr. Chazelle to provide even a modicum of verisimilitude. I'm talking, of course, about how Mr. Chazelle's antagonist, the martinet music instructor, Terence Fletcher, would even last five minutes at a prestigious music conservatory, given his vast repertoire of sociopathic behavior. Oh but wait'Whiplash' really is supposed to be more like a fable, so Mr. Chazelle is given a passhe no longer has to be beholden to 'conventional' narratives.But even fables should operate within a somewhat realistic world. And is it realistic to have Fletcher's co-worker shrink from him (are they all so afraid that they dare not assert themselves one bit?) Is it realistic not to see Fletcher's interactions with his supervisors (are they also completely browbeaten by him?) Would the administration allow such a person to continually humiliate his students, hurl ethnic and gay slurs, and actually throw things at the students, which could result in personal injury (possibly subjecting the school to a lawsuit?). Fletcher is clearly a caricature, who belongs in an army setting and not a music conservatory. Nonetheless, Chazelle needs the character to not only titillate us along the way but to illustrate his simplistic morality play, which entails a warning about the dangers of obsessive careerism.Now of course various naysayers will argue that there ARE people like Fletcher who seek to bring out the best in their students by utilizing 'tough love' but such pedagogues in real life must work within the 'system' and the 'pushing' is much more subtle than what is depicted here.The same goes for Chazelle's protagonist, Andrew Neyman, who plays the obsessed drummer student who seeks to get in the good graces of the ruthless Fletcher. Neyman is played by Miles Teller whom I liked very much in 'The Spectacular Now'. Since he plays drums in real life, Teller is pretty convincing playing the drums in the film. But Chazelle applies the same 'sledge hammer' approach toward the character 'Neyman' as he does with 'Fletcher'. Neyman wants to 'make it' at 'any cost'. He plays the drums so hard until his hands start bleeding (various drummers posting on the internet deny they've seen cases of this); and then on his way to a competition, Neyman gets in a bad car accident, but STILL drags himself to the performance and attempts to play (Chazelle seeks to prove the inane point that Neyman is so obsessed, that he'll do anything to wineven if it means playing seriously injured and jeopardizing his own life). No really, can you see anyone doing this? But again, since this is more like a melodramatic fable, Chazelle can have his characters do the most ridiculous things, and seemingly get away with it!Two thirds of the Whiplash plot concerns Fletcher's quest to supposedly bring out the best in his students (none of whom do we really get to know except Neyman). John Bleasdale writing in CineVue finds Fletcher's diatribes appealing: "His razor wit, sheer outrageousness, inventive taunting and vulgar insults are at once appalling and blackly funny." I agree that Fletcher's insults are appalling but "blackly funny"? Keep in mind that all the other characters who come in contact with Fletcher, have no ego, to the point that no one will oppose him. Therefore, Fletcher can get away with saying anything he feels like (some may call this 'wit', but in reality they're simply one note monologues--a set of variations on a theme).The second act crisis manifests itself when Neyman is kicked out of school after physically attacking Fletcher. The way back toward some kind of 'equilibrium' is when Neyman agrees to give a deposition in a lawsuit that eventually leads to Fletcher's dismissal from the conservatory.The Whiplash climax occurs after Neyman and Fletcher meet at a jazz club where Fletcher is now playing and Neyman agrees to play at a showcase. This turns out to be an ambush, since Fletcher arranges for Neyman to get up there without sheet music and he can only end up improvising (Fletcher is so demented that he's seemingly willing to sabotage the entire performance to get back at Neyman who he knows testified against him). Neyman runs off backstage into the arms of his good guy father but suddenly summons the courage to come back and play, where he dazzles, performing an extraordinary drum solo. Has Neyman triumphed after enduring the humiliating set-up? Not at all! He merely plays into Fletcher's stratagem to push him beyond his limits emotionallyeven if it means that he must sacrifice his dignity and self-worth by allowing the mad sociopath to manipulate him over and over again.In order to accept Chazelle's tawdry tale, one must accept the conventions of melodrama. Clearly it's written as heightened reality to make a point about the sadomasochistic relationship between student and teacher. While Chazelle may ultimately view his characters at a distance with the correct moral upper hand, he mirrors Tarantino, by reveling in the violence that he is also attempting to disdain. The 'Whiplash' machinations end up more tawdry and sensationalistic than compellingly tragic.I would recommend 'Whiplash' for the excellent cinematography and of course all the neat jazz music. I'll pass on the storydue to its clear, unrealistic and melodramatic aftertaste. 
 If you are a believer in the clichéd notion that success can only come from obsessive dedication to the exclusion of all normal human interaction, coupled with mountains of degradation, suffering, humiliation, and physical torture, you will absolutely adore this worthless pile of clichés, stereotypes, and bankrupt cinematic ideas. The story of a young jazz drummer who is brutalized by a sadistic teacher in the interests of spurring him to greatness is one of the most repulsive exercises in sheer idiocy ever committed to the screen. I watched and watched, waiting for some valid point to emerge from scenes of torment, bleeding hands, broken relationships, hideous nastiness and all the rest, but in the end, all we get is a whopping nonsensical cliché that only a fool could buy into. J.K. Simmons (the psychologist from Law and Order) does a credible job as the sadistic teacher, but honestly, no one could do much with a part this stereotypical... he couldn't have been more villainous unless he had a mustache to twirl. And the rest of the cast doesn't do any better with their phony baloney parts. Folks, if you don't have a credible story based in some form of recognizable and believable reality, nothing else matters. The fact that this one gets such a high rating on IMDb proves that HL Mencken was right: No one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public. 
 It amazes me that a movie that promotes such level of fascistic perfectionism gets so much praise. I say fascistic because the sick perfectionism of Nazis was one of the main reasons they thought it is OK to gas millions of people. If you are not perfect based on our standards you don't deserve to live. This movie tells us if you are not Charlie Parker I feel free to humiliate you, insult you, hurt you and abuse you, and it is all justified because if you are Charlie Parker you don't mind this level of sick manipulation. What a disgusting message. Yes, the actors did a good job playing these sick characters, and the movie was well made, which makes it even more dangerous. 
 Take a cheezy D-list sports movie script complete with the cliché bullying, demeaning coach with the tormented, misunderstood athlete (reality: narcissistic, self-righteous, arrogant, spoiled and immature child who needs to grow up) -- replace these 2 characters with a jazz music "teacher" and a drum student at an "elite" music academy. Neither character has ANY redeeming qualities - if the writers thought they were creating complex, intricate characters they failed miserably. The ending only shows how pathetic both truly are. I assume the writers (and anyone giving this film a positive review) felt they reached some great epiphany at the conclusion - they didn't. Only a tired out re-tread storyline completely out of proper context. A jazz drum student and music "teacher" are not soldiers in boot camp and learning to play drums is not a physically demanding, super- human endeavor as this film tries to lead you to believe.In reality the "teacher" is a glorified conductor who thinks he's something special but does nothing but destroy his students desire and passion. He is also an admitted complete failure at his misguided goal of creating another Charlie Parker. The "student" is equally self-absorbed and rude excuse for a human being. Only thing positive is he seems to be a pretty decent jazz drummer - but that's it. Character has absolutely ZERO going for him other than that. Other than that he's completely disrespectful and dismissive of everything and everyone else.This film (along with Birdman) sums up how pretentious Hollywood is and the excrement they promote at awards shows to convince themselves they have some higher "intellect" or "artistic genius." No one will remember Whiplash or Birdman other than as an embarrassing side note in Oscar history (remember Shakespeare in Love, didn't think so - Google it). 
 (biased but educated review from a jazz drummer student)I give 3 points because:-the movie is entertaining (wich for me is a major factor)i take seven because:-The plot is 100% unbelievable.-The idea portrayed here that to get better at jazz drumming (or for that matter any music genre and any musical instrument) you have to injure yourself, suffer psychologically and practice with tension in your hands/arms is exactly the opposite of what playing/practicing jazz drumming is.The only way to get better is practicing relaxed an being constant...improving in baby, but solid steps.-There is a special accent on playing fast as hell as a mean to be considered "the greatest", and also indirectly in the importance of reading musical scores, when in reality, jazz drumming is a lot more about feel and dynamics, , creativity, coordination and improvisation (without reading any musicl score at all but knowing the form of the song and listening to the other players to interact in the moment).So the movie is a fiction, but not tagged as if. The only thing that can relate with reality is that it can be considered a caricature of a very turbulent student-teacher relationship. Also can be considered a good way to show teachers and students WHAT NOT TO DO. 
 No need for a long review here. I am disappointed and amazed at the overwhelmingly 9 and 10 star reviews for Whiplash from Users and Critics alike. I agree that the performances are great, and for them I give some stars. In spite of the acting the film/screenplay ultimately glorifies cruelty and abuse to achieve success. I mourn the fact that we have become so insensitive to traumatic, inhuman treatment. I might have felt differently if there were rewards for winning over cruelty rather than glorification of bothSadly submitted,Michaellouie 
 First of all, English is not my mother tongue. Excuse me for the mistake I made in this review.Every one seems to like this movie. It is weird that many people seems to avoid to talk about the message or don't think this movie have any massage at all. But for me the message is loud and clear: You must Insult, humiliate， mentally abuse and physically violate your student to make them good. That's the only way to encourage them to achieve greatness. As a student you must take any advantage you can, no matter what it is going to cause. Remove everything except the thing you want to master from your life FOREVER, otherwise you are not going to be successful. There are lots of things in the movie that state these message clearly. The most obvious one is the ending. Both Andrew and Fletcher achieve their goal. They achieve it beautifully. Andrew did a improvisation at the end and create his own music. Fletcher get his Charlie Parker. Detail like the poster in the school, says something about end up in a rock band. The fame of Fletcher's band in the movie. Every single effect that Fletcher occur to Andrew like in a scene, Andrew describe other drummer's performance as this s**t. Some information that state the disadvantage of Fletcher's way of teaching are blurred out. such as the Death of a student that I forget his name. Student that Fletcher send out the classroom are never seen again. Fletcher's impact to other student. Those information mentioned in the movie disappear immediately. People who find these message and buying them certainly never been through a teacher like Fletcher or at least doesn't been through for a long time. I jump to this conclusion because I did, and I know what kind of damage Fletcher's way of education will do to the student for a long period of time. When I was about 10 years old, I had not one but three teacher just like Fletcher for two years. I was in my primary school back in China. Violence is the most usual way of their punishment. we got beaten after we didn't do very well on homework, misbehave on class (usually talking and not paying attention), I once broke my arm during these days. At the time I actually like they use violence, because nothing come close when they decided not to use it. When they insult you they never run short of fancy words even we are just kids. I hope I translate them more correctly so you can understand them better. Ones I have a classmate that didn't do well on their homework about handwriting. The teacher says these word in front of 46 kid: From now on, your name is piece of s**t (my classmate's last name) because your handwriting is s**t. and your parents are big s**t. they should be regret about f**k 10 month before your birthday, because you are not worth it. That is one of the thing they said that I remember the most. and after that, little s**t become his nick name. he accept it and we make fun of it.And humiliation . that is for every one who didn't "do well" on their test. Every morning before class. A question well be asked to everyone in the class:"who is the one that get the lowest score?" after that the kid that get the lowest score will be forced to say:"I am a worthless piece of crap, everything I know is to eat and s**t."If any of these thing don't make you think about Fletcher, I don't know what will. In fact I fell Fletcher is a saint compare to them. because those kind of torture last 2 years long and I was a 10 year old kid.Here come the worst part.At first those insult works very well. After a long time I start to accept every word they say. Remember I said my classmate accept his nickname little s**t. I start to accept I am a idiot, I cant do anything right, I am worthless and pathetic. Those word don't make me fell I am willing to break the barrier any more. instead they become a relief. An excuse for not doing well. After over 10, I sometime still fell the same way. I find a psychological statement that describe it very well called Learned helplessness. I am no psychologist so someone please tell me if it's true or not.Back to the movie review. I don't think Andrew is making any sense according to my experience. And this movie is a training course for a**holes. 1/10 Good Job for harming the director the most. 
 I was very surprised to see this movie do so well at the Oscars. The movie in a nutshell, to me, is exactly how NOT to teach anyone anything. The story walks you through a jazz class with a Drill Sergeant for a teacher that physically and verbally abuses his student in the name of greatness. The key message is being supportive, respectful and compassionate will get you nowhere. Hitting, abusing and destroying people will make your great! Hollywood for years has been advocating against bullying and now they give not one but three Oscar to a movie that glorifies Bullying??!! I was dumbfounded and sad. Yes, the performance s are great and the actors are very good, but no degree of acting should justify glorifying this method of teaching. What I hated most was that the movie made me like Jazz less. If this is what it takes to have great Jazz musicians then we do not need Jazz. Just to be clear. Hitting, screaming, psychological warfare, abuse and negativity DO not create great people or better musicians. They create abusive, disrespectful human beings that will continue the hate and the abuse. No wonder suicide rates for young people are high; if you are not good enough you are not worth playing, studying, living, etc. Just kill yourself. A very bad message to kids, students and teachers. Dreadful, Hollywood should be ashamed. 
 I just can not understand how this movie does get so much acclaim. The whole movie is just so unrealistic. I have learned and practiced 2 instruments here in Europe and can only say when I watch how this Shaffer character treats musicians like football players, this would never work. In such an environment any musician would get so tense and so full of fear to fail, he would certainly do exactly that. This is not how musicality and technique is teached. Never. Music is not sports. What Shaffer does may create a robot band that plays precise like a computer. But the music that comes out that way will sound alike. People in music are sensitive. Teaching is a process of mutual understanding, respecting and elevating between teacher and student.Further, a good drum technique with speed is not achieved by such tensioned convulsion, it needs the right finger and hand control and swing.The acting is certainly admirable but the cuts are sometimes worse then just distracting. 
 Homophobic and antisemitic insults, psychological and physical torture presented as working methods to motivate a teenager! Do I really need to write more to express how wrong this movie is, despite all the good acting and amazing editing? Since when geniuses and talented artists have all been mentored by a sadistic psychotic maniac that should be locked up straight from the very first slap or insults? it is a SCHOOL. S-C-H-O-O-L.An insult to all worthy teachers and mentors more successful than this Fletcher as NONE of their trainees kill themselves and nevertheless do reach their best.Liking this movie with no restriction at all is being an accomplice of teen suicides. 
 I laughed my head off at every scene in this movie! It was hilarious! The whole thing reminded me of an SCTV skit. I expected John Candy or Martin Short to come out at any second throughout the entire movie. Now I know why musicians and music students are making fun of this movie all over the US. I was a HS music teacher for more than 15 years, and a professional musician my entire life, and I've never seen a funnier movie about music in my entire life. The only one that came close to this was Ken Russell's version of "Tommy", but Whiplash took itself much more seriously than Tommy did. People are getting more and more brainless about music every day (especially jazz), so it didn't surprise me that many people thought this was a good movie. I guess I'm not as angry about how bad this piece of garbage was compared to the other people that gave it a bad review, because I waited for it to come out on DVD, and didn't waste a lot of money seeing it in a theater. This would make a great feature on Mystery Science Theater 3000 it's so bad! 
 Well acted? Sure. Decent directing and production values- yep! Plausible or realistic storyline? Not at all. There is no Shaffer Conservatory. Berklee College of Music in Boston used to be heavy on big-band jazz, but now the school has become far more vocational. None of the conservatory's I am aware of feature jazz as a curriculum, and if they did, it certainly would not be a major. No music professor in the USA would have a job if they behaved the way Fletcher does, and more to the point, no JAZZER would ever behave this way under any circumstances. Jazzers are not confrontational or competitive, that would contradict everything they stand for. The way the other musician behaved and talked in this film is not even remotely accurate AT ALL. Real musicians in REAL life, ESPECIALLY JAZZERS, are brotherly. A professor would never come into another professor's class and take over, would never physically abuse a student or yell at them this way ( with intense profanity, humiliation, and gender-insensitivity). A teacher wouldn't come in and insult the entire ensemble EVER. They would never audition them in the manner Fletcher does. They would never focus so much on the drummer, nor would they put so much emphasis on a stupid and pointless competition. The JVC Jazz festival, like any other jazz festival, does not have label-people attending to scout for new talent like baseball scouts. Labels are overrun with demo tapes and web links to downloads, and his remark that if you screw up they will remember you for the expressed purpose of denying you a deal is absolutely inane.I have NEVER seen a drummer get bloody hands just from playing fast: a stick only weighs about 2 ounces and is very smooth. Oh BTW, drummers never share sticks. Sticks are very personal, and ALL drummers, in a music program, carry a stick bag with them like a woman carries a purse. I have never seen "alternate" drummers in an ensemble or page turners for drummer. Big-band rehearsals at 9AM? Are they joking? You'd never get that many musicians to be at class that early and behave like soldiers in bootcamp, NO WAY! Are we to believe that Andrew get tossed from school, before Fletcher, because he messed up playing a song in a competition? Seriously? Even though he was bloody from a car accident? Maybe if this imaginary tale took place in hell, it would have slightly more credibility. Hollyweird NEVER portrays musicians accurately in a feature film. This is not a powerful movie, it doesn't make a point or carry any type of profound message and it doesn't portray musicians or music-schools with an accuracy at all. Im sure its fooled a lot of lay-people. 
 I'll be brief.Although the soundtrack is nice (if you like jazz) Both the characters and the story are unreliable. For once, a real music teacher with such character would have had his ass kicked out of school pretty quickly.So, it's kinda like "Fame" - only the jazz version that takes itself way too seriously!Also, J.K. Simmons character is not too far from his previous 'Schillinger' role. Only this time - he got out of (Oz) jail and decided to turn his anger and neo nazi tendencies into music.Bottom line (only because IMDb requires at least ten lines) - much much overrated. 
 I didn't "enjoy" this movie though I don't fault the fine acting. Movies successfully pitch an alternate reality when internal consistencies makes the unbelievable believable. In the movie The Matrix, as in many Sci-Fi flicks, the director establishes environmental rules and all the characters operate within that framework. My objections to Whiplash focus on its extreme examples of behavior which are so extreme as to make them conspicuously inconsistent with the movie's time and place. Those extremes strain the credulity of nearly every key player. I couldn't take the movie seriously despite its fervent desire to make a case about over-the-top efforts / sacrifices and what some people think it takes to win. There was little / no back story to convince me any of the characters would either act like that, be allowed to act like that, or be the recipient of those same actions. It's caricature upon caricature. The movie's conclusion provided some semblance of redemptive believable cohesion but by then it really was too late and I found the whole setup very contrived. 
 I can't believe that people rate this movie so highly and I can't believe that this crap was nominated as Best Picture of the Year. All I can say is that I am so glad it didn't win. I'm not even sure I am glad that J.K. Simmons won an Oscar. This movie is bad from beginning to end and totally unbelievable. I'm not a musician and I don't even like Jazz, but I'm sure no music school would employ or tolerate a teacher like Fletcher. People would report him much sooner than it is portrayed in the movie. There are other scenes that discredit this film. For instance, when Andrew, the student, has the auto accident, he walks away from it with hardly any injury (although the car overturned) and makes it just in time to the music hall for the concert. Yeah, give me a break! Fletcher is a sadistic prick, but we are supposed to believe he is moved to tears when he talks about a former student who killed himself? Total nonsense! What really irritated me is that the Fletcher character is so surreal and disgusting, and that Andrew, the student, is so obsessed. Any normal person would have quit or at least reported the teacher, but no, we have to endure this "drama" until the "glorious" end. I found the solo so boring, I couldn't wait to get out of the theater. I only went to see this horrible film because it was nominated as best picture. I praise all the brave people who wrote a bad review... this movie deserves it. 
 (Only mild, generalized spoilers ahead, do not worry.) I have played the drums in a Big Band for over 15 years, from my teenage years until well into adulthood. 90% of the time with another drummer, sharing duties. Which is exactly the scenario here, so naturally, i was intrigued by this movie. And it started off promising. A young drummer is eventually invited to practice with a prestigious Big Band. Many of the little details depicted here are pretty much on point.But i cannot begin to describe my disappointment in what unfolded on the screen. The drummer and the band leader (and even the other band members) display such sorry behavior that it becomes tough to endure. You want to raise your voice to the band leader, in place of the drummer and other band members, who fail miserably to stand up for themselves. Instead, you have to endure scenes of bullying and manipulation, and people taking it lying down, like prison inmates going through a boot camp.Only the behavior shown here is worse. The people in this movie are not desperately trying to reduce the length of their prison sentence. Instead, they are desperate for acceptance, for approval, for prestige, for fame. They accept humiliation, they accept being put down, and they do not stand up for themselves. On the contrary. They think that this is alright. They have embodied the whole twisted concept of it all. A society where striving for fame and for outside approval beats any sort of moral values. But shouldn't these values be the most important? To think for yourself and to stand up for yourself, to have values and to defend your values, when people try to coerce you, manipulate you or attack you? But we see people that were brainwashed enough to play along with this farce. Worse, to even support it in a way.If this wasn't troubling enough, what also puzzles me is the overwhelming praise this movie gets by critics and viewers alike. Have we really become so morally degenerated and cynical that this sort of story is now worthy of the IMDb Top 100 Greatest movies of all time? Let me clarify, my objection is not about the production values, the actors (well, a bit), the camera-work or anything like that. It's about the story that's being told, which is the most important part by far, after all.Another thing: This is supposed to depict the act of playing music together, which should be a joyful thing. Playing in a band is a celebration, a give-and-take between the players, an almost sacred and highly social interaction. And a band leader is good when he gives advice, not critique. When he develops people instead of using people. When he motivates instead of manipulating. When he inspires enthusiasm instead of fear. When he is leading, not bossing around. In this movie, they get everything wrong.Overall, i'm thoroughly disappointed with this movie on several levels. I reluctantly have to give this Top 100 movie the lowest score, simply due to the overwhelming urge it gave me to stop watching it. 
 I admired the cinematography and the acting, and at the start, thought this would be a great film. But then the bullying and violence started... The first episode was shocking but gripping, and I wanted to find out where the film was leading. It turned out to be leading up a blind alley. The sadistic teacher was a ridiculous stereotype, the bleeding hands were just plain unbelievable, and all the other members of the band just sat around watching but not reacting to the appalling abuse. This method of 'teaching' wouldn't work; there is a big difference between pushing students to achieve more and violent bullying. And the idea that such violence and aggression could lead to students producing better music of all things, would be laughable if it wasn't so sick. I was tempted to walk out but watched till the end, hoping for some kind of balance or note of realism. Unfortunately, there wasn't one and the final triumphant performance merely seemed to validate the cruelty. Yes, the cinema audience clapped at the end, and that made my stomach turn. 
 I expected from this film much more then I saw. I think music is not about military discipline and swearing, it is just the opposite. How important is for a drummer to play his drums fast? Not that important. I think this film was made more for the actors and music editors then for the music itself. What a disappointment! It is also disappointing to see that this film took more Oscars then Boyhood. It is sickening! I really would like to add that I really expected more about this film then it delivered to me. I am sorry but I would not recommend this film for you to see. It is just so disappointing. 
 My contrary reaction to the phony film WHIPLASH:1. Fake jazz: Jazz is the vehicle to tell this story, but what we get is not jazz but rather the academic teaching of big band/orchestral music, emphasizing arrangements and perfecting the technique of one's instrument. Same film could have been better scripted about a classical symphony orchestra at a university. Jazz is about improvisation and the interplay between musicians, as seen in a small group context. Big bands as seen here are more evident nowadays at sporting events. The only solo was the hero's mediocre drum solo at film's end.2. Fake theme/ending: Theme of the movie is the importance of motivation & rigor to promote excellence, in the context of a student, and the pitfalls of the martinet. In movies, for audience manipulation and dramatic purposes a theme is often betrayed at the end, most famous case being Alec Guinness's sudden reversal at the climax of THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI, because an audience expects the damn bridge to be blown up, even though his character spent the previous 2 hours with every fiber of his being symbolically building it. In WHIPLASH the finale contradicts everything previously in the script, not to be even-handed but to falsely convey a message that "maybe" true artistry and achievement stems from the horrible inspiration we've witnessed. Totally bogus and phony.3. Fake characters: Given jazz's history, the two major characters - protagonist and antagonist, should have been Black. The filmmakers have every right to make them whatever they want, perhaps a female teacher and a girl drummer would have been interesting, but that also would not have fit the use of jazz as movie's central core. My reaction to the whitened-up story was the same reaction as I would have to a '50s movie biography of Fats Domino played by Pat Boone, whose early career was essentially spurred by the industry (and specifically his record label) customarily ripping of a Black artist (Fats) with a white artist (Pat) singing his songs for a general audience. Same crappy approach here.4. Fake gimmicks: Many gimmick scenes in WHIPLASH would have been blue-penciled and not made it into the final script had this been a TV episode rather than an independent ("anything goes") feature film -the writers' room would not have permitted them to slip through. Most notable is the hero's car accident and arriving late and bloody to unsuccessfully try and perform at the big concert contest, when the band's other drummer was perfectly capable of going on in his stead. Not merely unbelievable but farcical as directed here. Final reel of him conned into appearing with no charts for songs he had never seen or heard before was an asinine gimmick, almost as stupid as him returning to suddenly lead the orchestra himself, all for fake-dramatic purposes. And maybe even worse the scene that made me want to leave the screening: his blow-off of his girl friend telling her his need to practice and succeed would not leave enough time for their relationship to continue. That must have looked bad on the page and it didn't play at all on the screen.5. Fake performance: I have praised J.K. Simmons many times, and you can read my rave review for him on IMDb for his role in the obscure comedy NEW IN TOWN. But his facile, surface performance here is just the kind that wins awards (it surely did), but pales into comparison to many others playing essentially the same role. I will merely cite Robert Duvall in THE GREAT SANTINI or Lou Gossett Jr. in AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN as the most vivid in recent memory. I found his playing closer to the psychotic of Humphrey Bogart in THE CAINE MUTINY than to what the role called for.6. Fake icon: Buddy Rich is elevated to god-like status in WHIPLASH, a reactionary and outdated concept that I reject entirely. In show biz history I would nominate Rich for iconic status as a jerk, not a musical artist. In jazz history, the logical icon and role model here would be Art Blakey, since not only is his importance in modern (post-WWII) jazz secure but more to the point he became the archetypal leader and inspiration to hundreds of musicians who graduated from his band, ranging from formative stints for Wayne Shorter and the Marsalis Bros. to little-known connections with artists as varied as Chick Corea and Chuck Mangione, both of whom I saw appear with Blakey's Jazz Messengers in Boston in 1966.. Unlike the teacher posited in WHIPLASH as a Dick Cheney-like nut, Blakey motivated rather than tortured his young acolytes. Buddy Rich and his mediocre '60s big bands yielded nothing, and as a drummer he was all technique and zero jazz.7. Fake porn: Categorically WHIPLASH (the title is perhaps the key hint) is a type of soft-core pornography, among other things. It's another movie example of the trends in recent years to substitute sadomasochism for traditional sexual porn - namely the thousands of horror films about torture and sadism appealing to the audience to alternately identify with and then hiss the sadist as protagonist, or more recently the oncoming trend that will be inspired by the success of 50 SHADES OF GREY. The movie's domination theme is obvious, but the submission aspect is way more subtle -masked by the hero's natural rebelliousness. Looking beyond him we have a score of submissives -his fellow band mates who are humiliated (a key element of BDSM cinema) throughout the film. This as entertainment is the definition of pseudo-porn, acceptable to the masses because it does not involve "money shots" and explicit penetration making it soft-core rather than hardcore. The absence of sex in WHIPLASH is no different than the absence of actual sex in most BDSM exercises.8. Fake setting: L.A. substituting for NYC = zero atmosphere. 
 On the face of it this is an over the top unrealistic portrayal of the odd subject matter where a coach drives his charge to the limit. But that message gets a little confused as the movie progresses.... is he just psycho? Pretty typical of a lot of movies being churned out of the US these days relying an sensational exaggeration and graphic language rather than a good story. The drumming was poor and the drummer no Phil Collins. The general public in the US must be so gung-ho to accept this drivel.... if all you have to be is a loud mouth abusive jerk to get an Oscar then I give up. I warn you... if you have any taste at all you will be disappointed! 
 Do you know who I am ? " asks the film's protagonist as the audience are introduced to him Yeah you're that Nazi dude who enjoys raping all the new arrivals at the Oswald State penitentiary . Yes JK Simmons is back playing an Oscar winning role which isn't all that different from the role OZ fans know him for . It's nice to see that this years Oscar nominations were heavily in favour of indie cinema . It's even nicer to know that this is the film my fellow members of this site was the pick of the crop from 2014 film releases so sat back hoping to get blown away by itSo is it any good ? Yes but I should quickly qualify this by stating it's not really the masterwork some people might claim it to be . One criticism THE HURT LOCKER received was that you could easily rework the story as someone who has become addicted to adrenaline . Instead of a bomb disposal man you could have the story involve a fireman who takes more and more risks and so it's the same with WHIPLASH . How about a brutal drill instructor trying to turn weak civvies in to efficient killing machines ? That's already been done a hundred times before and so here we've a reworking of a familiar story in a slightly unfamiliar setting of a music school . It's a slightly predictable story and in order for it not to be so predictable there's a few plot turns involving situations that become rather contrived and unlikely to say the least What stops it all falling apart is director Damien Chazelle using all the tools at his disposal involving editing , sound mix and cinematography to disguise the flaws in the story telling . Certainly many directors nowadays think editing revolves around taking as much cocaine as possible while mutilating any coherent on screen action . The editing style of WHIPLASH is some what showy but is genuinely admirable at the same time . It's nice to actually watch a film and notice the editing while never being irritated by it WHIPLASH is one of the better films of 2014 but it's probably a film that's easier to admire than to like . I did like it but didn't love it and I'm not in a great hurray to watch it again 
 Filmmakers have paid for positive reviews for decades before IMDb, and I can't think of a way for IMDb to protect against false or paid input.Consider with WHIPLASH, this film proved nothing but limp at the box office, not to be found anywhere in the top 100 for 2014, yet there are 176,500 votes for it on IMDb and most are for 10, 9, or 8.Then consider this is unoriginal, badly acted, boring film.The hero wants to be the World's #1 musician. Fine! So he gets J V Simmons to scream obscene language in his face and plays his drums until his hands bleed (Ridiculous!) Let me tell you about course language. Any idiot can excel at it. King size fools like the J V Simmons character have nothing else to offer; else-wise they could communicate without it.The boy still goes to the movies with his Dad. Sweet! At the movies they distinguish themselves by adding Milk Duds to the large tub of popcorn and blabbing through the show, making other people move away.Later, he masters the courage to date the pop corn girl and takes her for pizza. Wow! This adds substance to the later scene when he dumps her because he needs the time for his music.There is just nothing original or interesting going on here.Whiplash is one of the very worst films of 2014. IMDb would be so much better if it was kept honest and clean. I hope the producers enjoyed the $1.60 we paid to rent the DVD, but next time I'll think twice before choosing anything from Sundance. 
 Hard to rate this film because there's so much to like - the performances, the unusual story-line, and the fact that it's about jazz. Still what stays with me is what I liked the least about the movie - the fact that Fletcher's torturous and reprehensible methods seem to be validated in the end. I really wished the kid would have succeeded in spite of Fletcher and showed him that his methods only cause irreversible damage and sometimes even death. Abuse is not the way to make talent (artistic or otherwise) blossom - McCartney, Spielberg, Federer, Bach, Evert, Picasso, Da Vinci - there are countless examples of genius without without abuse. Maybe jazz is different? I doubt it. 
 I'm giving Whiplash a one star rating to compensate for all the rave reviews it has gotten from people who obviously know nothing about about how music is made, and what goes into great performances.Almost the whole film is about the relationship between a talented teen drummer, played by Miles Teller and a teacher, played by JK Simmons, who directs jazz in a top music school. The JK Simmons role is a sick meld of an evil Nazi from WWII, a brutal drill sergeant and a father who is both physically and mentally abusive. His head is shaved, he wears a black "muscle" shirt almost continually in the movie, he screams at his students, uses language that makes George Carlin seem like Mr. Rogers, throws chairs, and finally slaps the Teller character in the face, repeatedly. I don't think there is a minority group he does not insult repeatedly, with just about the worst four-letter trash talk imaginable.The fact that the acting is impressive can't save this film. The script is terrible. And it does a disservice to music education in a time when support for the arts is already struggling.Worst of all, the film misrepresents everything that is real in both music and music education. Anyone seeing this film and thinking of going into a music program for the first time would be so turned-off The film is about mind-rape. It is about the worst kind of damage one human can inflict on another in the name of teaching without leaving a great deal of physical damage. It has nothing to do with music, or creativity, or teaching. It is Hollywood at its worse.There are some abusive musical directors who have way too much power, but this fictional character would not last one week in any music school. One student would simply turn on an I-pad, record what goes on, then pass it around.The teacher would be out of a job and most likely in jail.One reviewer called it a "steaming pile of excrement". Apt words. 
 There's only one thing worse than a ludicrous, shallow, artificial movie, and that's a ludicrous, shallow, artificial movie that everybody seems to adore.Whiplash wants to be about the love of great art, but is actually about the hate of great art. It has JK Simmons - a brilliant actor - playing a disgraceful character, stitched together from completely unrealistic, inconsistent motivations and actions, only conceived to bludgeon the viewer into thinking we're watching something profound. It casually tosses in assault, depression and suicide in a way that only a clueless, opportunistic director could. It has a big finale that would be powerful if only it made some sense for the main characters involved - it doesn't.Even worse, the finale leaves us with this unmistakable message: sadistic leadership is the way to greatness. Don't take your kids to see this. 
 Whiplash is a terrible, unrealistic movie. First of all, of all the musical forms in popular culture, Jazz is one of the most relaxed and organic. The fact that the music director is characterized as disciplinarian is reminiscent of the "classical" genre of 60+ year ago (Toscanini, Bruno Walter, etc.), where musical directors ruled with an almost fascist like iron fist. This changed years ago in "classical" music and was NEVER the case in Jazz. I am a former professional Jazz and classical musician who studied at top music schools, and creating great Jazz is about relaxing and being in the moment, not being frightened to the point of crying because of an evil music director.Secondly, within the first 20 minutes of the movie, the music director throws a chair at the student and then slaps him!! This is called ASSAULT, and would NEVER happen (or more to the point, be tolerated), in any academic institution, minor or major! Certainly not in the US (or in New York City, as in this case.) This alone completely discredits this movie in my opinion. It's an unrealistic piece of crap that should not ever had been made!! This movie is a discredit to the beautiful art form that is Jazz and an insult to all who teach and play it. 
 In some ways this was quite a strange film as it has virtually no build-up; we start with Andrew (Miles Teiler) playing the drums for a few minutes before his eventual mentor Terrence Fletcher (J.K Simmons) walks in and observes Andrew playing the drums. After liking what he hears, Terrence offers Andrew a place in his band....Not only do the problems start for Andrew at this point, but it's at the point where the band first assemble that I started to have problems with this film...For the next 80 minutes all we have here is Terrence Fletcher - man of mystery; so what do we know about him? Well he's a man that seems to be sponsored by Accurist, he's a combination of the drill sergeant from Full Metal Jacket and Simon Cowell or Nasty Nigel Lythgoe. The majority of the film shows the band playing music (admittedly I initially liked this aspect of the film, but it was repetitive and wore thin after a while) then we have Fletcher shouting at his students, putting them down etc. The only thing that was moderately entertaining about the first 80 minutes was hearing Fletcher's put downs, but after 80 minutes of it I was losing the will to live. Think about hearing some of Simon Cowell's put downs on the X Factor; it's fun for about 5 minutes, but hearing an 80 minute omnibus edition on You Tube would drive me insane.The film even fails for me at a very basic level; it isn't entertaining enough to make it fun to watch, it isn't fleshed out enough to make it a good character study or social commentary and for the most part it isn't interesting enough to keep you involved in the story.There are some other things that had me puzzled such as; what was the point of Fletcher asking Andrew to be there at 6am only for Andrew to turn up late and then Fletcher not be there? This thread was opened up without purpose. I also loved the fact that Fletcher claimed he knew that Andrew made him lose his job at the Schaeffer conservatory of music, but given the fact that he mistreated almost every student he taught how could he possibly know that it was Andrew that dropped him in it? This isn't a total shambles and it is, at least, fairly well made and Simmons is very good in his respective role and did at least not render the film totally unwatchable. Where Whiplash really comes good is in the final 15 minutes and in these 15 minutes we get more revelations here than we did throughout the 90 minutes or so that proceeded it. It was rather unexpected to watch Fletcher be prepared to sabotage his own big night just to show Andrew as being incompetent. To then see Andrew come back and show us some of his best drumming was absolutely fantastic. It's a pity that the earlier parts of this film did not have the same passion and intensity as the last 15 minutes.Ultimately, this is meant to show the pressure of show business and it's also about how being too self-absorbed can affect not only your own life, but the lives of others around you. It's just a shame that for the majority of its running time Whiplash tackles this in a repetitive and dull manner that offers little insight, commentary or entertainment. It does all three aspects to an extent in the last 15-20 minutes, but for me it was a case of too little too late. 
 The film isn't bad, but nowhere near what I had expected in a movie that won Sundance among many other things. Yes, JK Simmons is fantastic, but I want to know who the producer convinced that Simmons should have been nominated in the Best Supporting Actor category rather than Best Actor in this movie. He's in plenty of the picture. Of course, he couldn't have won Best Actor, but he'd be a shoo-in for Best Supporting Actor, which he won in spades.Towards the middle and continuing to the end, the plot became ridiculous. Getting smacked by an oncoming truck where your car flips over, and then running to make your concert? Physically attacking your teacher? Going back to play drums for the instructor that you despise, and then how does he not know a certain song will be played, when everyone else does? Didn't he have to practice with them...like ever? 
 Not just in the music, but the characters as well. There's no soul in the main character's musical drive--he doesn't do it for his love of music, but more for his desire for fame. When he gets rejected, he goes home and takes down all the posters of his drumming idols and disassembles his drum kit. Now, I might just be a novice drummer, but if I got let go from this asshole teacher's band, I would be much happier for it and continue drumming for fun, on my own accord. The kid doesn't seem to listen to much except the technical side of drumming (Buddy Rich), and focuses more on how fast he can hit the drum rather than how to incorporate the drums into the rest of the music. This movie makes it seem like the drummer is supposed to hog the show, or at least it celebrates it at the end. Sure, the kid was "pushing his boundaries", but it doesn't necessarily make for good music or make a good musician.This is without mentioning the parts that detract from the realism, such as his constantly bleeding hands (I don't think Charlie Parker or Buddy Rich lost a gallon of blood each session) or his incredible one-hit KO through the snare (I've tried this before, and am slightly less scrawny than this kid--no dice). There are only two characters in this movie. The rest are so flat I can hardly notice them. His love interest might as well have been left out because there isn't enough of her to make you care about their relationship, and what we do see is that he's kind of an arrogant douche boyfriend. Hard to relate to this type. There are good performances by the two characters, but that's the only thing carrying this movie. The writing is packed full with homophobic slurs that quickly tire out, and unconvincing dialogue abounds.I like drumming, I like jazz, and I respect musicians who work their asses off. But I couldn't sympathize with any of the characters. I found only superficial lessons (if "'Good job' kills artists" is even a lesson), and couldn't feel any heart in the music. I think most people were impressed with the well-acted shouting and fast drumming and "artistic insight". This is not how creative music is made, and, despite my hopes and wishes, this is not a creative movie. 
 Having spent most of my entire life in music playing drums and teaching the art, I can tell you that there are so many things wrong with this movie, it's laughable. The absurd, over-the-top, face-slapping scene in the trailer was enough for me to avoid seeing it. But, at the urging of a friend - a non-musician who thought it was "great", I caved in to my curiosity. His taste in movies aside, he's still my friend, and I was right in my initial judgement. Watching the entire movie was a waste - I made it half-way through and ditched."Whiplash" is an unadulterated load of crap. 
 Seems to me the only people who like this movie are people who know nothing about music. The film tries to get you to buy into some kind of polished, elite fantasy world that supports our belief that success comes at great sacrifice. Which it sometimes does.. but this movie is absolutely ridiculous.People become musicians out of LOVE for the art. They aren't pushed to "achieve greatness" by sadistic asshole teachers. Also, Jazz is far less rigorous and robotic than this movie would have you believe. Jazz (and Blues) have always been about self-expression - play, spontaneity, colour, contrast & emotion. Lots of great jazz players are self- taught and never even went to music school (see Django Reinhardt). Many can't even read music.This (American) movie completely fails to understand one of Americas own greatest cultural exports. As a Brit, I appreciate the irony - I can only conclude the writer must be a total dipshit. 
 It's not as boring as 50 Shades of Grey, but it's just about as simplistic. There are two characters, plus a couple of others are hinted (at with several seconds of screen time).I loved the music. The acting was good, but the roles were not especially nuanced.The main problem is that within the first couple of minutes of the film, you know Andrew's goal: to be an elite drummer. Great. You also realize that his instructor is complete jerk (or worse) and is going to "challenge" Andrew. So, for the rest of the movie, all we have to wonder about is whether he'll end up overcoming the challenge and being a good drummer, or whether he'll give up.It kept my attention, but I would never watch this movie a second time. There just wasn't enough substance to it. There was no nuance. There was nothing more to think about.The pseudo-philosophical, pop-psychological discussion in the movie about whether abusive treatment by a teacher is justifiable by the potential for producing greatness are just pathetic and empty.There are some shades of side-story. There's a paper-thin character of a girlfriend. She only exists to make us believe that Andrew might be giving something up by pursuing his goal, but since Andrew isn't likable at all, I didn't really care if he ended up with her.Anyway, the movie wasn't really a 1 star... I give it a solid 6.5, but since it's been voted so high here on IMDb, I'm just trying to bring it down into the realm of reality. 
 I cannot believe that this film has received so many good reviews. I cannot believe that this film was Oscar nominated for "Best Motion Picture of the Year". Here's IMDb's synopsis of the film: "A promising young drummer enrolls at a cut-throat music conservatory where his dreams of greatness are mentored by an instructor who will stop at nothing to realize a student's potential." This film, however, is about a bully music teacher who insults, assaults, slaps, degrades, and humiliates his students to death. Literally. This film is realistic only in the sense that it depicts the catastrophic effects bullying can have on people's well-being. Everything else in the film would simply not happen. Other reviewers, with music knowledge, have explained why such music institutions and teaching practices and methods are implausible, nowadays. I am a psychologist and I can verify that bullying will not and cannot motivate a person to become greater. Peoples' potentials are most likely to be crushed as a consequence of bullying. Victims of bullying do not easily "overcome" or "harden up" to become better human beings. Moreover, victims of bullying tend to become bullies themselves, later on in life. So, I would claim that this is a film about the making of a bully.I am a big fan on violent films and I have felt emotionally exhilarated  completely satisfied  after watching films like Oldboy, and Sympathy for Mr & Lady Vengeance. Whiplash left me feeling disgusted, wondering about what kind of people made it, watched it, and enjoyed it. 
 A plucky young drummer heads to the big time and cracks under the pressure of a dictatorial band director, pushing him to come back to greater heights. As a sports movie, Whiplash is very effective. Unfortunately, it doesn't really have anything to do with music (or reality), and its vision of artistic achievement comes with some very unsavory undertones. Let's consider for a second the ludicrousness of its melodrama. No music director would slap his players, use abusive language, or trash instruments in the way portrayed in the film. The film falls apart if you question its equation of jazz and big band, or question whether becoming a player with Jazz at Lincoln Center is the pinnacle of achievement. The film also never addresses the racial context of jazz, which is a nearly unforgivable sin. But it's the whole mythos that holds that art is effort and effort is abuse and therefore any abuse is justified in the pursuit of greatness that is the most offensive to me. Anybody that's ever tried to get good at anything has met teachers like Fletcher, and they suck. If the movie stopped at being a portrait of toxic masculinity and the danger that comes from bad boundaries, then it would have done its job well. But it seems like the filmmakers and many of the people that are praising this movie fundamentally admire Nieman for enduring through his trials, and that's very disheartening to me 
 I like when Hollywood dares to cast a young actor that doesn't fit their standards of beauty. The lead worked extremely well with his character and quite frankly, I think that's what kept me riveted. Adversity fuels him, exhaustion is merely an obstacle in his path. The actor's nervousness and receptivity is mesmerizing and will entrap you in his world. The camera could have pulled a Lars Von Trier, standing just behind his shoulder and it would have felt the same.While the audience isn't courted so much into caring for the characters, the story does bring its emotional content with themes that appeal to everyone. The desire to make something out of your life, the sacrifices, the labour. But who knows how it will end? It's different for each of us.JK Simmons was remarkable and his chemistry with the lead could have been better but it was sufficient. It was just enough to hold the movie together.Now the bleeding hands were great at first but that quickly wore down. Everyone one of us who's ever played an instrument (which is everyone), knows the hardship isn't in the playing but in the accuracy. I get that his main struggle was to keep up the fast beat but as I said, the bleeding hands metaphor quickly wore down. If it had been a trombone, would they have made his lips bleed? The fingers of a piano player? It was just too much. Sweat would have sufficed.Ups and downs - not the greatest movie I've seen this year, but good. Pretty good. It's an 8/10 for me; would recommend it to a specific crowd only. 
 The movie starts with a drummer in action in a band room at the end of a long, dark hallway. It is the first encounter between student Miles Teller as Andrew and teacher J.K. Simmons as Fletcher. Andrew is a student of great drummers, in a pizza joint with a girl he names the 1930s song playing and the drummer in the band. Attending this prestigious private music school in NYC is to be his springboard to greatness.But while he knew of Fletcher he didn't know what a wild man Fletcher was. Seemingly out of control in his over-the-top criticism of musicians who may be off just a little. And using ethnic and gender slurs to berate them. Such behavior probably would never be tolerated in a real school but it is necessary for the resolution of this story.Paul Reiser is good as the dad, Jim Neimann and cute Melissa Benoist (of Glee and the next Supergirl on TV) is Nicole, a girl Andrew starts dating but stops because he says it will not be compatible with his drive to be the best.JK Simmons won the Oscar for Best Supporting actor and the movie itself was in the running for Best Picture. Many fans think it should have won over "Birdman." The movie is hard to watch at times but it all pays off in the final couple of scenes. SPOILERS: After weeks of on-again, off-again verbal abuse Andrew snaps after failing to perform well after an automobile accident right before the performance. He rushes Fletcher on stage, tackles him, both are bloody, Andrew is kicked out of school. But a family representative of a former student who hanged himself convinced Andrew to witness to Fletcher's behavior, and he was terminated. But in an accidental meeting Fletcher asks Andrew to play drums for a gig, actually setting him up for failure by opening with a number Andrew did not know and didn't have the music for. However next Andrew began to play a hot number, stood up to Fletcher, had the other musicians come in, maybe Fletcher finally had his star. 
 Really an inspiration movie, which felt me like a music student who sitting under pressure with J.K. Simmons role, real hard way to hang on music as hard life, till the end. I think each shot you had perfectly depicted to movie without losing the intensity, special thanks to J.K. Simmons. The J.K. Simmons and Miles Teller, characters made this movie more powerful which made audience kept on toss.As this is a really story experience and best part is how beautifully the screenplay which made this film stands out from crowd.Electrifying moments which made me felt that I'm student in the band, a fear to play the instrument with proper numbers...All the best Damien Chazelle, for your future assignments :) This movie will be one of my best liked movie in recent years. 
 For all of its widespread critical acclaim and multiple award nominations and wins, I found Damien Chazelle's 'Whiplash' to be a rather thin and clichéd regurgitation of the tired "Driven artist, intense student/mentor relationship" trope with absolutely nothing fresh to say or offer up.I believe its reputation is primarily built upon the strong performances of its two leads, Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons. Though both characters are paper thin, each actor absolutely inhabits them in a way that adds a dimension that isn't on the page. Their impressive performances only make me wish that much more that the material were up to their level. 
 When the poor little ambitious drummer bloodied his precious hands - practicing JAZZ drum!! Hahahaha.....People buy into that? Seriously??? Hahahahahaha.... And I'm not even a drummer, just love all kind of music like most people. JAZZ....causes bleeding callous fingers, and reading music notes to improvise...LOL... This student has serious issue....There is not excuse to give this film anything more than 5 for research laziness and technical fails alone!But brutality sells! The moral of the story is, criminal level of abuse is justified, as long as the victim (sort of) survived it.I read a few "Loved it" reviews out of curiosity. Found 2 schools of people who praise this nonsense to high heaven:1. FUTURE BULLIES ---- this school believes in the power of hate and brutality. In the name of whipping the hidden greatness out of young geniuses, they damage the children soul so the child will grow up perfect like a murderous sadist with hidden explosive piles who would in turn mental-torture and bleed future children to suicidal edge. 2. The Devil's Minions ---- this class does not see abuses even if it happens to their own baby infant. Their (narcissistic) narrative is people are always doing it for MY benefit, even if it hurts real bad. It is my fault or my children fault, to not transcend the pain or swallow the excrement of hate wrapped in a politically correct 'toughen up you wimp', which is what this film is apparently about, in all seriousness too.I'm trying, I am, to find redeeming value. Like, maybe, "talented kids" these days have become too coddled and soft and cry and whine at little insults? Opposite is true. Kids these days endure unprecedented amount of verbal abuses in school AND online. Skins have become too thick if anything.Okay, maybe... Kids have become too disrespectful of the craft side of art and need to be reminded HOW HARD IT USED TO BE to be qualified as a real music genius? Maybe, if jazz or drumming is supposed to define musical greatness. LOL, seriously. Keep your children away from any teachers or coaches who "love" this film with all seriousness.Watch it for good laugh. Very funny the more seriously brutal it gets. 
 The main argument of this film is that music is like a sport. You have to put yourself to the limit to be a top player. And this is not true for music. Music is all about feeling and soul and touch audience with the performance, not to be able to play at 400 BPM. Being a musician is an inner path to lead to a self discover. Virtuousness come with the practice and talent, but not being assaulted physical and emotionally. Music is an art, not a competition, so is subject to be interpreted in many ways, so being a best musician is not matter of math or time clock. Jazz is a language, not a race. Photography and editing are superb in the film, that's the only thing I liked. 
 This movie is high on my Top 10 Most Over-rated Movies in recent years list.Posh school authority can act like mafia lord and cause great psychological/ physical/ property damage - and students of the free-est nation on earth had no guts to give him a third finger, or laugh out loud, or throw it back at the abuser, change school, make police report...etc etc? Instead the "good guy" bleed on to get....approval? Or pay high price to get...tiny little revenge victory? Seriously? The moral(s) of this story: there WILL NOT BE justice - and that is why good people (like poor little me) resign to cowering and performing tedious soul-destroying grunt work to get breadcrumb of approval. But the actors are good and emotionally convincing despite the absurdity of it all, and the production value is high quality. So I'm not going to mock the general audience for buying into "OMG getting a music degree is even harder than qualifying to be a dental surgeon!".I do fault Hollywood for scaring off potential big dollar music school customers especially from overseas. Even the most militant tiger moms would think twice now sending their children to American music college now! Oh no. lol.Musicians - music school or self-taught, classical or pop, will find the two leads sado-masochistic professor-student interaction utterly ridiculous at first, and then resigned to just laughing at the writer/director's desperate attempts at "creating conflict and dramatic tension" where there is, well, little. Musical craft is just boring, sustained repetition. The rest, talent/ greatness, is individual.What shocks me the most are not even pro critics high praise - these are cynics by nature. Why shocks me is how people seem to be okay with being abused and shamed and scapegoated in the open, in supposedly civilized places, work or academia. In more conservative modern Asia, yes I can understand high rating for this movie, people resonate with a "good guy" who "endure" absurd level of undeserved abuse. But the West? Really?Integrity is not just a nice virtue on paper. It is a survival necessity. Financial survival, and artistic survival. I need a lead I can respect, and root for. I can't root for this one. Not even at the end when he attempted to fix the situation. Some may find that heroic. To me it was too little, and too late - for him. The favorable rating of this movie is probably saying... 1. Unreported criminal abuses by authorities in USA academic institutions are under-reported2. There are more Stockholm Syndrome sufferers among educated adults of the world than I thought.Watch it for the good acting performance, mediocre musical craft. Brace yourself for unnecessary cartoon brutality. 
 This movie was a terrible, unrealistic, over the top ridiculous waste of time. The only redeeming part was the great orchestral jazz, but the characters, story and, well everything really, means this movie should not be getting the positive reviews it has. Where in the world would anyone be able to get away with treating students like this? It's utterly ridiculous cr** and I cannot believe this was even given approval be made in these days of human rights and anti bullying. What a disgrace. In addition, we found the story so predictable - it was sort of like a REALLY bad Rocky but based on music, except Rocky had heart, soul and a relatable endearing underdog story. All the characters in this were totally unlikeable, unrelatable and awful, who cares what happens to any of them? All in all this is an over-hyped horrible sad attempt at movie making and a great opportunity totally missed. 
 If this were to be a parody about success and how to achieve it, it would receive 10 stars from me. Unfortunately it is not and the high ratings it has achieved baffles me.Firstly, let me state that I do not understand music from a professional or enthusiast's point of view.In my opinion, the movie portrays music as a mastery of some technical skills, following a fixed(or slight variation thereof) tempo. It removes anything remotely positive involved in learning or teaching music. The main characters throughout the movie were only involved in inflicting pain on themselves or others in order to satisfy their ambitions.Secondly, no character development or a back story. All the characters came out the same at the end of the movie as they were in the beginning. The only change being Andrew could play better(yippe!).Thirdly, definition of success (of being a 'Great') and the path to it. The movie portrays success as a neurotic obsession with ambition(never music - never got that feeling, always about being up there) and a desire for proving people who have humiliated you as wrong as the road to it! What is wrong with people? In my opinion succeeding at something requires true passion and love for it. Yes pushing ourselves is required along the way, but if the entire journey consists of it, the feelings with which we will reach the other end would be a far cry from sunshine and rainbows.In brief the entire movie consists of a sadistic instructor fishing for a student who does not break when methods resembling whack-a-mole are employed and succeeding(YAY!). 
 What a wooden film. As a viewer, you cannot really get to know any of these characters. Nothing great comes from an abusive teacher. Hitting student in the face, really? No. It was unclear what JK Simmons' character really was after. Was it perfection? Is the only way to achieve perfection by humiliating students with verbal and physical abuse? The drumming was excellent. I'm a musician and I've never heard of students bleeding all over their drums. It's ridiculous. The only thing JK Simmons' character cared about was tempo. Talk about unidimensional. He crucified students only if they couldn't determine his tempo after a few beats. What about dynamics? What about interacting with the band? The script was superficial and lacking. People probably like this film because Simmons was an interesting character and the drumming was interesting. You'd think such a brilliant teacher would be a more impressive jazz pianist - another boring scene. 
 Right off the bat, you'll want to know this isn't a typical Hollywood story. The writer must have skipped day one of Screen writing 101, as he forgot to include a likable main character. From the first moment the teacher is introduced, you'll quickly develop zero sympathy for him. Less than zero, perhaps. He is, after all, the antagonist. So far, so good. In my ignorant and ill-informed opinion, the main problem with the movie is the student's character. We've already got a clearly defined villain, so how about somebody to root for? He seems to start out that way, but slowly he morphs into a borderline bad guy, as if under the spell of his mentor. After a while, one's only interest in the student is to hope for him to break free of his psychotic teacher. A day after seeing this movie, it's hard to believe it was nominated for an Oscar. From a technical standpoint, it was well made and featured good acting, but the story itself was somewhat off-putting. I'm a big fan of J. K. Simmons, but his character was so abrasive, I actually started looking forward to the scenes without him. Maybe it was the screenwriter's intent to make us feel uncomfortable. If so, he succeeded. Sadly, though, I can't say my life is any richer having seen this. 
 This film tells the story of a young drummer who us accepted into the most prestigious music school in New York. The teacher there is very strict, even abusive physically and psychologically. The story then tells how the enmeshed relationship between the two evolve.The music in "Whiplash" is great. It's like going to a jazz concert, especially the finale performance at the end. For the plot itself, however, I did not like it at all. The teacher is very abusive, and dies everything he could to stir up rivalry and hatred among his students. The worst thing is that the film gives him time to justify his abuse. Abuse is not right, and the film allows abusers to give twisted reasons to justify something wrong. That really angers me. Coupled with the fact that his students keep on receiving the abuse, it evoked a lot of anger in me. 
 After the hype all around, I went in to watch this movie with a lot of expectations. Especially because I haven't seen a movie on drumming, at least not a drummer as the protagonist. I have to admit, I am a little disappointed.Drumming is an art. One needs finesse to be a drummer. Here, in the movie, it seems all about 'speed': playing fast tempos. Double time and triple time. To the extent blood oozes out of your body. Is that the definition of good music? Haven't the makers of the film heard of 'rests' in music charts. What not to play and when not to play is more powerful than what you indeed play.And why is it that the Conductor Mr.Fletcher has his eyes set only on the drummer. Not once did we see him interact with the other musicians of the ensemble.With all that filth and anger from the Conductor, one really wonders if any good music would ever flow out from that band? It reminded me of the great movie 'An officer and a gentleman'. The Commanding Trainer in the movie was arrogant and ruthless for a good reason. But not so in 'Whiplash'. 
 The fact that this movie has earned high rating from its audience is understandable - in the end, a bad sadomasochistic taste of mass audience is no longer a secret. What surprises me is critical acclaim - it seems that critics aren't gotten far ahead from the public for which they write.As for the movie, it is grotesque, stupid sado-masochistic fiction, indulging bad taste and low inclinations of its viewers.Most sad thing is that someone not to bright might decide that this degenerative movie is actually depicting reality and will try to bring such kind of decay into the real life. From the other side, actual maniacs and degenerates might see this movie as an indulgence to their actions. Well, now I probably understood who those critics with positive reviews on this movie are :)3 out of 10. 
 I've never quite understood why it's become a pejorative to refer to a movie as "manipulative." Truth is, most of us go to the movies to be manipulated. That's kind of the whole point. Writer-director Damien Chazelle  at least on the evidence of this sophomore feature, Whiplash  is a master manipulator. The movie is a sleek machine that works you over and bats you around until the climax incites the audience into the kind of frenzy I haven't seen in an auditorium since Rocky beat Drago. It's viscerally thrilling, and distressingly hollow.Whiplash stars Miles Teller as Andrew, as aspiring young jazz drummer studying at a New York conservatory. Hopelessly devoted to his craft, the kid catches the ear of this school's legendary instructor, Terence Fletcher. Played by the great J.K. Simmons as if auditioning for the lead in an R. Lee Ermey biopic, Fletcher is a bullet-headed, ball-busting martinet  an emotionally abusive sadist of almost super-villain proportions. He recruits Andrew for his competitive Studio Band and then proceeds to humiliate, badger and berate his new pupil to the brink of a nervous breakdown.It's Fletcher's belief that if Jo Jones hadn't thrown a cymbal at Charlie Parker's head during a gig for which he was ill-prepared, the wet-behind-the-ears saxophonist never would have buckled down and become Bird. Fletcher throws a lot of cymbals, and plenty of other stuff too. He's had it up to here with a generation raised on participation trophies and he excoriates the words "good job." Fletcher demands excellence, no matter how many obscenities, homophobic epithets and pieces of furniture he has to hurl at his students to get the desired result.The sheer pleasure of watching J.K. Simmons in this role should not be understated. A key utility player in this past decade's films finally stepping into the spotlight, he conducts temper tantrums with mathematical precision, at times diabolically lulling the kids into a chummy sense of security before unleashing his splenetic rage. Clad in black muscle tees, Fletcher is often half-glimpsed lurking in the shadows like a B-Movie monster. (If I've learned anything from Whiplash and the 1980 Fame, it's that Performing Arts Schools in New York City are lit like the Corleone family living room.) Andrew flourishes under his mentor's drill sergeant methodology, and the film begins to feel like a sick parody of inspirational teacher movies. Desperate never to end up like his schmucky father (Paul Reiser, perfectly cast) the kid callously tosses aside his girlfriend (Melissa Benoist) and practices all day and night until his hands bleed  recurring shots of which Chazelle is a bit overly fond. Whiplash subscribes to the notion that artistic greatness requires monastic self-abnegation  a canard that's ruined many young men's lives and gets taken out behind the woodshed in next week's Listen Up Philip.Expanded from a short film that similarly dominated Sundance in 2013 (this story has won so many festival awards in one form or another I half-expect juries to start inventing new categories in which to give it prizes) Whiplash raises a lot of pertinent questions about bullying and self-discipline, only to sheepishly back away without exploring them in any depth. Chazelle's script leans on a couple of eye-rolling contrivances, and I think it's long past time to retire the de rigueur, out-of-nowhere car accident tossed in at the end of the Second Act to raise the stakes whenever screenwriters can't figure out a way to do so organically.Of course, nothing else matters if you can wow 'em with the ending, and Whiplash has a doozy. Andrew and Fletcher finally square off onstage in a kinetic, feverishly prolonged musical crescendo. It's a breathtaking sequence, with editor Tom Cross' syncopated Fosse cuts ramping up the intensity to an almost surreal, nearly unbearable pitch. Whiplash has the kind of finale that makes you momentarily forget all your reservations about everything that came before. No surprise to discover that Damien Chazelle was a musician before he became a filmmaker. His real gift is for playing a crowd. 
 This masterpiece film holds a rare honest view into the cost and need for excellence in millennials' lives.My expectations: fairly low. I did not expect the film to be so powerful for me as I am not one for jazz bands. Expectations exceeded, I think about this film quite often, although I had to be begged to watch it.Recommendation: Film lovers and casual cinema goers, I believe will enjoy this film.Re-watch value: I have watched this film over 6 times since release .Memorable: I am still thinking about this film to this day. 
 This movie delivers a truly disturbing and sick message to impressionable young people. The carrot that it dangles is "excellence:" and "immortality", but the ugly reality is that this movie is about a sadist, sociopath music teacher who enjoys mentally, verbally and to a lesser extent, physically, torturing his students. The supposed drive for excellence is only the rationalization that the douche bag uses to get away with it. Excellence can and has been achieved without resorting to this sort of mental violence.Even more disturbing than Fletcher is Andrew, his student. Only someone with extreme low self esteem would subject themselves to the level of abuse he accepts. Andrew obviously has some serious psychological issues because he sabotages himself at critical moments so that Fletcher can have more reasons to insult and demean him. He seems unable to set an alarm clock, pay attention when he is driving and even more preposterously for a person supposedly obsessed with becoming the greatest drummer the world has ever seen, he forgets his drumsticks at a critical moment. The only conclusion you can draw is that he is a masochist.This movie is really about homoerotic sadomasochism, complete with jealousy fits. It's not about music or the drive for excellence. Make no mistake about it. 
 A misguided, erroneous, fallacious, manufactured, pseudo depiction, of Americas most beloved crown jewel, and most eminent, and revered art form...Jazz. It is upsetting, sad, and disappointing, that this movie will be someone's introduction to jazz, and insults those who support it. I am not a music authority, or historian., but know of the power of music., and that great art, has been sparked and composed from strong emotions, and adversity., i.e. "the desire to escape suffering leads us to think, create, and strive, thereby fulfilling our potential---suffering was not created for its own sake, but only to spur us on to new heights through dissatisfaction with the status quo"., not by bullying. I believe in artistic license, and a good yarn, but feel jazz should be painted with genuine hues of authenticity. This film, for me, was a missed opportunity, of something much greater, than what it was attempting, and ultimately failing to portray. A few of my personal favorite Jazz movies are...'Round Midnight (1986), endorsed by Clint Eastwood, from the Monterey Jazz Festival, Thank You Clint! and the documentary, Icons Among Us, Jazz in the Present Tense (2009) 
 most people don't. Jazz is dying for that reason. As a former drummer, if I had the choice between being the core drummer at Lincoln Center or being the drummer in a famous rock band I'd choose the latter.Most music fans don't care how fast someone can drum and they don't care for drawn out drum solos.Also, if there ever is another Buddy Rich or Charlie Parker, they'll be playing as unknown session musicians...there would be no fame and glory or people talking about them after they die..except for friends and family.They had their time and their time has passed.Great movie by the way, even though there is a massive plot hole with the JVC concert at the end..(as mentioned in this forum). 
 If this is already diminishing in my estimation minutes after watching, it's because it's about subjects that are dear to me, music, concentration, meaning in life and placement of ourselves in the larger music, but it has no insights to impart, or none that I have any use for.The whole is about ego pummeling away in the effort to be someone in the eyes of others rather than the joy of the craft itself, about clinging on to achievement than flowing on the creativity of the moment, about perfecting technique than cultivating soul, what Spanish musicians know as duende; the deep urge that rises from the body and cries to express itself as music.Now I'm not a fanatic jazzist who thinks the music should be portrayed in this or that original light, the film may well be seen after all to be about confused individuals who miss the point, a bad teacher. But the bad teacher who hammers home a trivial point is the filmmaker.We see how this clinging is more or less disastrous for everyone, how it derails them from expressing soul. It's also what puts them back on the stage. But I miss the deeper and softer insight here, for which jazz is a model, that we should indeed strive to perfect our craft, but that's so we can be able to use it freely and without obstruction, so that we can pierce through the sheet, the notation, to the real hum of music that spontaneously unfolds in the room where we play with others, become the instrument for music that plays itself.The film is in the end as small as what it shows, unable to pierce from merely polished technique to wonder or let go of fixation with accomplishment to begin immersion in fulfillment. It ends just as it would have to do that. It all builds up to a last scene of dueling between master and student for room in the stage that finally perhaps sublimates all the ego and hardship in music that sweeps both. In that scene we have a frantic display of ego as determination, but is his drum solo great music or merely an elaborate flourish apart from the music that the music has to stop for?And this extends in a cinematic way, the scene is adroitly edited but is it anything more than a piece of mastered technique, mechanical? (I wrote last year about a film called A Spell to Ward off the Darkness which has a much more spacious swimming of the cinematic eye, also incidentally between instruments on a stage, but faced the same conundrum, soul wasn't there, duende. This is bar none the most striking limit in expression with a camera since the beginning of cinema, one that every great maker strives to push back. Many have.) 
 I'm going to strictly avoid using expressions with musical terms, or that's what I would say if I knew several. Whiplash left me puzzled. It was maybe a labor of love, being a pet project of writer-director Damien Chazelle, of whom I've never heard of before. The movie seems to be an indie film with a staple of an action movie thrown in for good measure. A car accident, viscerally shown. Lately since the noughties it has been easier to show car crashes. So I'm assuming this one was thrown in to appeal to a wider range of fans.There are a few things I don't understand about the movie. Like the drum kit is one of the loudest and least quiet instruments of all. So how can the father (Paul Reiser), be so surprised about Andrew's virtuosity? Also The kid, the trumpet player, who 'supposedly' was playing false, really WAS playing false! All these little surprises didn't gel with me, because a) They were stupid b) They would work only if the hero was less smart than a comatose monkey, which in the movie, he was c) they shouldn't have mentioned Casey hanged himself because it's a distraction and you think he should have been the subject of the film d) the twists prevented us from knowing more about Andrew.The regrettable thing about Whiplash is that there is only one person who got the perfect amount of limelight, treatment, and attention, and that was J.K Simmons. The others got the same level of detail, which was wrong. Andrew is shown as a boy playing drums, and before that at a family dinner. He also dates a girl briefly. He is a very quiet lad with his band and with his girlfriend but surprisingly smart-Aleck and runs his mouth like a machine gun when the story asks for it. Not my tempo. That's all I had to say, hope you found the review helpful. 
 Whiplash is an astounding piece of modern day cinema. Its a film that leaves you physically shaking even after the second watch and with a complete sensory overload as you try to reconcile every element of that film that seems to have been seamlessly and passionately crafted. All that I hope is that Whiplash is not too overpraised in the sense that future audiences may meet it with harsh expectations and come away underwhelmed. Part of what made the first experience so special was that I had no expectations, I saw a short trailer and it was at a convenient showing time.Its excitement may dwindle, like sussing out a roller coaster, following its turns and loops from the ground before you even hit the queue. Whiplash is adrenaline cinema and is best met head on. 
 Yes, the acting by JK Simmons was very good, and yes the storyline was compelling regarding greatness, and how greatness is found and nurtured, or in this case abused.The idea is our society is too friendly and politically correct to be able to develop great musicians. The interesting concept of the film is that the mentor is as important as the mentee, which of course we already knew, but the idea was that the mentor must be willing to push the mentee in ways or manners the mentee would not do otherwise. Very interesting concept that could yield hours of interesting debate over a bottle of wine and a cigar.However, the movie does not behave like an Indy film, but like a Hollywood picture. There is far too much drama. The primary character (Andrew Nieman) bleeds no less than three times during the movie on his trap set! Seriously, bleeding! He gets in a car accident, rolls his car over, and runs to the recital he was late for while bleeding and unable to control his limbs from the trauma.Then there's the complete lack of character development of ANY of the characters in the movie. Why is Andrew Nieman so obsessed with music that he breaks-up with his girlfriend because he thinks she will eventually get in the way? JK Simmons is good, but sorry, I don't know why he behaves the way he does, nor would his style ever be effective, or accepted at any college, private or public.The idea that Charlie Parker became great because he had a symbol thrown at him is extremely trite and irrelevant to greatness. Again, this is not an accurate representation of the truth. The reason we don't have any modern Charlie Parker's is because our society doesn't care about Jazz music any longer, in fact it's the butt of many jokes. Jazz was played everywhere in Parker's day. You could buy a saxophone at JC Penny's for Pete's sake. Today, you can barely buy a saxophone at a music store. The fact of the matter is that people become great in areas that the people care about; football, basketball, baseball, and in the arts symphony orchestra. Yo-Yo Ma is one of the greatest cello players of all time. So did he become great because he had some dude yelling profanities in his ear? NO! How about 50,000 hrs of practice, and prospect of getting rich and being adored.So much hype and very little substance behind it I'm afraid, unless of course your used to watching Marvel superhero movies, so you've become abundantly inept at recognizing a good film unless it slapped you in the face. Which of course, JK Simmons does slap Peter Parker, I mean Andrew Nieman :) 
 This is easily one of the best movies of 2014. Whiplash will be the most intense movies you will ever see. J.K. Simmons is the best part of this fantastic movie. I was surprised how much I was terrified by his character. He defiantly earned that Oscar. Miles Teller was also great in this film. It has become one my favorite movies of all time. The music in this movie was also fantastic. Miles Teller is such a talented drummer. To some this movie might not be a easy watch, but I'm going to recommend it to just about any one regardless. I feel like a lot of people will enjoy it. Please check this film out. It has become one of my favorites of all time. 
 Whiplash is a beautiful movie that shows perception and expectations of a young drummer and an experienced band teacher who is short tempered and very strict.Movie is boring in starting but last half hour was amazing.JK Simmons was amazing as a Band teacher and he really deserves that Oscar for best supporting actor in a Supporting Role.Other cast was also nice.Watch this movie if you want to fulfill your dreams no matter how much hurdles are there in your life.My recommendation is that don't watch this movie with higher expectations.Overall I give this movie 8/10. 
 An enthralling thrill ride of a movie about jazz. Yep, that's right. Andrew (Miles Teller) is a promising jazz drummer who has ambitions to be the very best. Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) is the cantankerous, exacting, conductor whom Andrew needs to impress if he is to fulfil his dream.The two leads perform brilliantly. Simmons launches into Fletcher's virulent tirades with savage gusto, his frightening demeanour and victimisation of the promising pupil creating the initial drama and tension. We feel for Andrew as he suffers the verbal and physical abuse meted out by his potential mentor. A battle of wills develops with Andrew determined not to simply accept every degradation heaped upon him.In the interests of tension and drama, it's overdone. Whilst immersed in the events taking place before you, you may not notice. The film is that powerful. But afterwards, you are likely to think how improbable it all was. Scenes between Andrew and both his father and girlfriend feel superfluous, interrupting the savage narrative of the battle between Fletcher and Andrew.It's this battle that results in events taking a different turn. We are made to see both sides. There is no goodie or baddie, it's the tale of two obsessions in conflict and the ensuing sparks that fly. Then we reach the dramatic finale (no spoilers here) and watch it unfold before us like the drawing back of a taught bowstring, wondering where the arrow will fly.Excellent, gut wrenching, roller-coaster movie. Prepare yourself accordingly! 
 'Whiplash' is the story of two men. One is a young music conservatory student determined to be as good as his idol, Buddy Rich, on drums. So single-minded is he in this pursuit that he largely ignores other aspects of a normal, well-adjusted life, including personal relationships. The other primary character (J.K. Simmons in a career-defining role) is the most hard-ass music instructor ever. He curses, cajoles, intimidates and physically assaults his students, buffered by the philosophy that if he does not, they will never achieve greatness. Neither lead character will yield, and from that premise and tension flows the drama and some incredible jazz music. 
 Never thought I'd like this movie. Really love the drum playing and actually i was hoping that Andrew would play it one more time at the ending, instead he played Caravan. This movie also has a great plot twist. Wow, I should learn human character to anticipate what a person like Fletcher would do when he is felt betrayed. He's never be really good to you. He would revenge. Fletcher is like a male version of Miranda Priestly in The Devil Wears Prada, only severer. Can't imagine if someone suddenly throws hard object at me.Having watched this movie got me thinking that I haven't done enough for my dreams. I feel so small. Somehow I feel Andrew is too obsessed. You should see how hard he practices everyday to impress Fletcher, yet it's never enough for his meticulous ears. Luckily it ends happily, so there is good price to his every hard work. 
 An absolutely riveting movie. Terence Fletcher (the crazy good J.K. Simmons) and Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller) were both amazing in this, although really, Fletcher took the cake. His character embodies that fierce (and sometimes violent) drive in each of us, or perhaps some person in our lives that tries to push ourselves to the limit, which is what makes this movie so personal as this connects with the audience. While on the other hand, Andrew represents the dreamer in all of us, but is sometimes faced with the limbo between attempting to push harder or to give up. This is what makes this movie so engaging. The music in the movie, coupled with the drumming also adds to the tension in this roller coaster of a movie.The finale was also spectacular and epic. There's basically nothing to criticize this movie for. It elevates the simple idea of diligence and success to a whole new level and engages the audience throughout. 10/10 
 The good: Teller and Simmons commit like mad and sell the heck out of their characters -- basically, as many have pointed out, the only two real characters in the film -- enough to make their work together suspenseful and interesting to watch... no matter how silly the underlying premises.The bad: Neither character is all that likable, but moreover the cartoon levels of abuse that "Fletcher" dishes out to his students and especially to the protagonist would get him arrested and drummed out of the Marine Corps, let alone a music school. In the course of the movie, Fletcher doesn't just play head games and dish out deeply personal verbal abuse which on its own should be enough to get him disciplined; he throws chairs, kicks stuff over, humiliates and *slaps* the protagonist, forces him (in hilariously over-the-top fashion) to play until his hands bleed in order to "earn" a part, and makes him take the stage at a competition having obviously just climbed out of a car wreck... then boots him from the band when he can't keep playing. This character isn't an educator. He's an abuser. This is even made obvious by the suicide of one of his former students as a (minor) plot point. Fletcher is himself a (clearly mediocre) musician dealing with his own demons by desperately trying to become at least a footnote in jazz history, the man who threw a cymbal at the head of the next Charlie Parker. And yet...The silly: ... we're treated to an end sequence where a "meeting of the minds" occurs that makes no sense for everyone involved and seems effectively to make excuses for and reward Fletcher's abuse. The disposable and irrelevant subplots meant to sell the rest of the people in the protagonist's life as representing mediocrity don't come off, either. 
 Being a musician all my life and seeing this film makes me hate the main character. And more the teacher. He practices all wrong and he always has accuses. The best drummer doesn't made from playing fast, that is so stupid. The best drummer doesn't made from playing stiff, this is even more stupid. And the best music teacher surely doesn't made from a tough guy who do not the first thing how to teach, you can not push students like that to make great musicians. The whole point is to relax and feel the music. And swing is about feel the beat. You need to master the slow tempo so you can then be more accurate at higher tempo. What his film try to communicate about practicing and being the best musician is absurd. I stopped half way through the film, I just couldn't watch this non-sense anymore. The main character does also looks very dumb as a person and worst as a musician and I believe not many musicians can relate to that. I wish this film deliver the right message about what being the real musician is all about. If you get that wrong then everything is wrong. 
 This is without doubt a brilliant film I normally watch action films but thought I would have a break from action and I was not disappointed this film brings a brand new perspective to phycological abuse as the mentor pushes the kid to breaking point and beyond. I felt though at times especially the very beginning the drum solos were boring dreary and unnecessary. The ending was well thought out and planned and the plot was good I however wanted to see the farther of the kid meet the mentor for a period to see his reaction in front of the mentor. This film is a must see for anyone who likes something different to the normal films. 8.2/10 
 Damien Chazelle's Whiplash represents arguably one of the most exhilarating cinematic endeavors in the music genre in recent memory, let alone one by a man making his directorial debut. It is a music-themed that takes on the daunting task of delivering a feverishly thrilling atmosphere not from the emotional resonance of its music, but its bold psychological tone that proceeds its heart- rending story. By Chazelle's thoughtful direction and the uncompromising performances by actors Miles Teller and J.K Simmons, this film doesn't just achieves this task, it embraces. The story here is not one of your battle-of-the-bands tales involving a band or a solo musician shooting for the stars, it is a story concerning the complex and thought-provoking relationship between a young musician and his mentor. And it is one that hits hard in ways that a very few would expect. This film follows Andrew Neiman (played by Miles Teller), an inspired drummer who enrolls in a local music conservatory where he joins a jazz band conducted by the talented, but maniacal Terence Fletcher (played by J.K. Simmons). Fletcher is most certainly not a kind-hearted mentor, he is abusive towards his band and holds no bars when splashing his band with an severely ill temper each time one of them makes a mistake. Upon joining the band, Andrew suffers under Fletcher's mental abuse to pushing him to the limits, but at the same time, inspires the immersive talent he never knew he had. If you think you are in for another cheery and whimsical musical tale, think again. This film takes the music genre and grips with a dark twist, and Damien Chazelle accomplishes this in a way that puts the film on the border of a thriller than a drama. The narrative crux of the story is the complex relationship between an ambitious drummer who wants to exercise his talent to the fullest when he arrives to the opportunity, and a cold, anger-fueled conductor who threatens to tear him apart with his mental abuse, yet sees an inspiring talent in the young man. This all comes down to an exhilarating tale of a young man discovering his hidden talent, while enduring a harrowing maltreatment from his mentor that will leave viewers questioning his actions from start to finish. At one point, Andrew drums with such endurance to where his hands starts bleeding, while Fletcher is busy losing his temper and hurling chairs and instruments at his students. Throughout the picture, the story vigorously questions the actions of this conductor, but never answers. That alone makes for an astounding and thought-provoking aspect of the story. The biggest spark in the picture, however is the performance by J.K. Simmons as Fletcher. Channeling R. Lee Ermey's Drill Sergeant from 'Full Metal Jacket', Simmons doesn't just play the role, he swallows it with immense precision that allows his inspiring, yet grueling character burst out of the screen with great versatility. It is the kind of performance that simply grabs you by the heart and never lets go. Miles Teller on the other hand, shines like gold through his incredible drumming skills. It is a performance that not only allows him to expand his acting chops, but to exercise his musical talent as well. Whiplash is an intense, powerful, and electrifying cinematic endeavor with performances that are simply too difficult to ignore and an inspiring direction by Damien Chazelle that makes for an absorbing directorial debut. It is an astounding cinematic achievement that makes for a powerful contender on my list for the top ten films of 2014. 
 Isn't it time to review the rating system on IMDb? The time factor from release needs to be tweaked to accommodate the fact that newly released titles have tended to become more and more overrated. Otherwise one of the fundamental successes of IMDb will be devalued, and IMDb as a whole as well.With regards to the movie, I give it a 6 due to the performance of JK Simmons. Even if his characters unrealistic behavior is also the factor pulling down the verdict, he manages to make it less unrealistic in some weird way. Altogether it is a somewhat feel good movie with scattered story line and worthy of an average rating. 
 "Whiplash" on the surface is a tense, complex study of artistic struggle, obsession, and megalomania. I hated it. Not because it wasn't well constructed; not because it wasn't well acted; not because it wasn't well directed, it was all these things and more. No, I hated it for it's heart, its misguided insight into what art and beauty are truly about. It is not lost on me that any discussion or criticism about art could be argued to be completely subjective; I would still say that this movie does not reflect the beauty of art or do credit to the struggle of the artist. Thats not just my opinion either, to me that is a fact. I am not trying to argue an opinion here, I am actually commenting on something that I truly believe. It has been said that "Beauty is Truth and Truth Beauty". I believe in Truth and truth can not be an opinion. "Whiplash" takes a swing at what it believes is necessary to reach that truth and fails completely at capturing what it means to be an artist. This movie would have one believe that suffering, obsession, sacrifice and ugliness are the building blocks that "great art/artist" are founded on. I couldn't disagree more. As an artist myself I understand how all these "negative" motivators can drive an artist to produce art, even to produce great art, yet I feel this movie celebrates them as a necessary right of passage. That in order to be great one has to work harder; it implies that those who are successful are those who have suffered and sacrificed the most, and those who aren't just didn't try hard enough.(How many great artist has history ignored only later to discover their beauty?) Perhaps most disturbingly It implies that one's self worth is dependent upon the reception of their art by an audience or someone outside themselves. Enter the "evil" music/art instructor who's job it is (by this movies logic) to push someone past what they think is possible to open up new untapped potentials hidden away by psychological blocks of complacency and self-pity by employing the tools of cruelty, manipulation and terror. All this hidden behind some BS ideal that their is some great nobility inherent in not depriving the world of a great artist no matter what the cost. GAG!! What overblown melodramatic tripe. I don't argue that we all couldn't use a swift kick in the pants occasionally in order to rise to our potential,or that honest criticism can be crucial to progressing as an artist but to ruthlessly and doggedly bully and torture someone in the hopes of achieving said effect is where i take offense. Who the hell gave him that cross to bare anyway!? There is a line. This movie even mentions this "line" at one point and comes really close to reaching a redemptive conclusion....then misses the mark entirely and descends into the abyss. At this point the movie could have had some valid commentary on the consequence of tyranny and obsession and lifted itself to having a message worth sitting through. I had a glimmer of hope that the movie"s heart was true and had been enact all along. Unfortunately this was not to be. The scene that twists the knife comes when; after being set up and sabotaged by Fletcher, Andrew rises to the occasion against all odds and puts on the performance of a lifetime. Had he done this despite the villainy of Fletcher and the movie just ended, then one could have left the movie with a certain ambiguity, open to contemplating the various themes and questions the movie raises about art and the artistic process. However the damning evidence of the movie's actual message comes during Andrew's fevered solo when despite everything Fletcher has done to Andrew there is a nod of acknowledgment from Fletcher that conveys the approval that Andrew has been so desperately seeking and the movie ends as if something triumphant and beautiful has been brought into the world. Uunnghhh! Never mind that Andrew is an obsessive with no sense of self (or self worth), never mind that Fletcher is a maniacal, narcissistic power drunk bigot (who may have even played a hand in pushing a young mind to suicide), never mind that there seems to be no consequences for any of these characters in their pursuit of greatness. No at this point the movie decided to celebrate this twisted moment as a triumph of art and truth. As if tormenting a person is how great art is born. No I don't think it is cool to celebrate this message nor do i think it is healthy to celebrate Fletcher's and Andrew's relationship as justified and productive. As an artist it offends me with its clichés, I feel it lacks insight, responsibility and any awareness as to the very purpose of art. Art doesn't have to be beautiful, art can be dark. It is both and it is neither. Art is truth and that is all I would ever ask of any form of expression. In "Whiplash" I got pandering, "Top Gun"-esque melodrama and a self indulgent study in cruelty that pretentiously masquerades as if it knows what it means to be an artist. (2 stars for the undeniably fine craftsmanship and performances, but on those alone does not a good movie make.) -Sizer 
 Predictable Kirate Kid remake at the drum set. Besides some cool drum-lines and jazz performances here and there the storyline is infantile. Can't Hollywood think of an original storyline. I could have predicted the ending in the first 10 minutes.At various points it just descends into comical farce, but not in a good way.It also sends the damaging message to everyone that abuse between teacher and student ends up being beneficial, so in the end the film defends and supports that abuse.How this film can ever be considered to be in the top 100 movies ever made is beyond me. 
 Awful waste of time. The same end result (the amazing drum performance by the kid) could have been accomplished a lot faster and effectively with positive reinforcement. They way the bald bastard teacher physically and verbally abuses his students is plain disgusting. A clear example of exaggeration to give the story line a greater climax. A F#$%ING TRUCK crashes right into his car as he puts his phone down in the car. He shakes of the injuries (bloody arm, head, and face) and runs to his class to join Fletcher's performance. The acting can't be taken seriously, instead of being pulled into the movie, the Fletcher's bad acting and "over exaggerated" teaching style made me close the movie 30 minutes in. Please don't waste your time watching this over sensationalized rendition of "true" events. 
 In fairness, I probably shouldn't write a review or give a rating as I walked out after an hour. After all of the many positive reviews of this film I couldn't wait to see it. This movie is like a twilight version of Glee. The teacher throws a chair at the main character, the drummer... thank God the drummer ducked otherwise he'd be dead. The teacher both physically and mentally abuses Andrew. This teacher would never be allowed to teach in the best music school in the country and he has no passion for the music, he's a robot.It seems to me that a lot of viewers are equating yelling, swearing and violence with intensity and great movie making. 
 I went into the theater to watch Whiplash with very little knowledge of the film other than it's about a drummer.I enjoyed the first 30 minutes or so of the movie and wondered which direction it was going to go. Obviously something was going to happen between the music instructor and the drum student but what?The movie ended up being primarily based around their relationship, which basically focused on excessive practice and verbal abuse. The movie failed to capitalize on other relationships such as with the drummer's girlfriend, or relationship with his dad or fellow students. Two other student drummers suffered through the same abuse and you'd think that even though they were competing for the same spot, they'd bond on their hatred for the instructor.The only interesting scene dialog wise was really the family dinner which was funny yet short. Almost all of the other dialog in the film was the instructor yelling.The final 30 minutes of the movie didn't sit well with me at all. The student and instructor meeting in the bar and talking over drinks was unlikely seeing how the student had hate the man. I don't believe the student would've given him the time of day after what transpired.Then the instructor, who for the entire film was 100% set on protecting his reputation, intentionally tried to embarrass the drummer in front of a huge theater that also had people with connections to the industry. I don't believe the instructor suddenly would've been OK with potentially negatively affecting his already tarnished reputation just to ruin the drummer's chances after the student had already made the decision to give up his dream.The final scene where the drummer and instructor/conductor seemed to come to terms also seemed unlikely.In the end there wasn't enough dialog and the relationship with most of the characters didn't go deep enough to make it a great movie in my mind. 
 On 13 November Whiplash  directed by Damien Chazelle starring Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons  will premier at the Netherlands cinema. This movie about an ambitious and talented drum player and his dominant, relentless teacher, is expected to do well, based on the positive reception it had in many countries and at several festivals. Even before its release the movie opened the Leiden International Film Festival, and won the LIFF Indie Competition. General appreciation is also shown at IMDb, where the film scores 87/100 with about 4400 votes.The story that the movie brings forward is not new. Andrew, a young drum player, enrolls at the high-class, well-reputed Shaffer Conservatory, where he meets Fletcher, an infamous teacher working with high standards and non-compromising methods. Andrew attracts his attention and a struggle between the two characters begins when Andrew secures the position of first drum in the school band practicing for the national school competition. The movie focuses on the two main characters, and the way in which they interrelate with the aim to realize the best drum performance for the school's honor, but more so for their own prestige and ego.Although the movie excels in cinematography, acting and music  provided you at least like some level of jazz music  the story doesn't seem to convince. The strict focus on the two men and their sole purpose leads to repetition in the narrative, following the cycle of insult and pressure from the teacher, hard work and pain by the student, and short-term victory for both when a performance succeeds. Even at the end of the movie, when things seem to turn around, the teacher again tries to push the student into a great performance, which he indeed delivers.Additional characters, such as the student's father, girl friend or other musicians at the school, are just there to support the main story. They never get any depth or backgrounds, and their role is minimal; they are there to underline how determined and ambitious Andrew really is. The school functions as decor, with musicians as extra's and no sign of a board, other teachers or school infrastructure.Focusing on one aspect of a human relationship can produce interesting and compelling movies, but Whiplash is not a good example. Besides the elimination of all surrounding factors, there is another possible reason why the story doesn't convince me. The general idea underlying the story is that real talent blossoms with hardship and pain. Consequently, the message is delivered that it is good to bully and mistreat a student with talent, so that he or she gets to full development. To my mind this message is not true, at least not always, and needs more justification than a flat, straight story about two egocentric men struggling for power and recognition. 
 People may quickly picture Whiplash as the Full Metal Jacket of jazz band: there's Fletcher militarily pushing his student, Andrew, to get his task right. The hatred towards the mentor becomes the character's motivation of achieving his orders perfectly; and the similarities could end there. Although this is a very different context; the harsh, shout-y discipline and sometimes its negative human effects are quite reminiscent. But without any grim twists, this movie just sticks directly to one's determination of being successful to his job, either for the instructor or for himself. This is one rough environment that takes you to a relentless study of intense rehearsals and intense discipline until it reaches to the point where their goals lose out of control. And just like those sequences, Whiplash keeps most of the viewers from their comfort zone, and leads them to rewarding results.Movies like this, specifically relationship between a student and a mean teacher, conventionally ends with a heart changing sentiment, possibly leading the two to an unexpected life-long friendship, but Whiplash takes it stone-cold; hardly showing any sign of friendliness in their bond. The only way for the young drummer to gain his own light is to roll with the punches and learn exactly what the band want him to do, even if it costs much of what he has in life. This is supposed to be an image of inspiration, but the film mostly portrays the nightmares of this "never give up" ambition; which transforms the dreamer into a mad man who is few steps away of breaking down. Nonetheless, this unending pressure brings real impact to what lesson this movie is trying to show.The filmmaking is spectacular all in all, each of its musical scenes makes for a truly grandeur show, but the core here are the ones that is mainly about the drums. They are impressively played with relentless intensity, while the camera strikingly displays the flowing literal sweat and blood of the drummer; indicating his committed exhaustion. The performances are the spotlight, especially J.K. Simmons who has done perfect to his character. It might have been easy for an overacted performance, but Simmons finds the sense of humanity beneath what it's written, making Fletcher reasonable to furiously shout at any intolerable flaw of his students. Miles Teller also killed it, recognizably for the drumming parts, but aside of that, he convincingly follows through the character's obsession, until he turns closer to insanity.Whiplash often feels cruel, but there is an important reason for that. It depicts a serious way of motivation, you can feel that in every beat of his terrifyingly breathtaking drum performances; this is mostly the reality of being unstoppable to what you are desperately aiming for, plus driven by fear and hate. But eventually, the film makes a clear point why their world of music have to be this bitter. Overall, it all works by choosing clever directions, staging magnificent musical set pieces, and remarkable acting from its two leads. Even if the story is quite simple, its heart tends to overwhelm you. 
 I ask you to forgive me if i have taken so long to write a review of Whiplash, but even today i am not sure i can. I do not know how to capture the emotions that build in me when i watch this film. I will do it the other way around.I really do not care for the segments of Andrew(Miles Teller)'s personal life. Yes, they do add a bit of character development, but outside the story. The real development is his development as a drummer. And how Fletcher(Simmons) affects it.I confess that i am a music professional. I went to music school and while the teachers are not like Fletcher, the exaggeration of his character in Whiplash is an expression of the drive that successful musicians truly have.We have all had bleeding fingers, passed out from practicing too much, and putting music above everything else. All these things are true, and i accept that Whiplash exaggerates it to make you SEE what musicians FEEL.Now, on to the production. The photography is superb. I love every camera angle, ever light shot. The direction and dialogue are flawless. Teller has his limits as an actor, but he fits perfectly in this role, and Simmons was born to play the part of Fletcher. I have watched this film 13 times. I decided to give away the DVD because i would have probably watched it many more times again. If you are a musician, you are not complete unless you watch Whiplash.And for the others .. well, Whiplash is a weird film. It might struggle to get its message across to you, or you might simply not be interested or not realize why Andrew is the real winner in the last scene, or what he has accomplished. It breaks my heart, but rules are rules.As this film is aimed at a limited audience, it can only score:9/10 - a monumental masterpiece for anyone involved in music. 
 Wow, I could say many things about this movie, but I'll try to be simple. It is just and only one of the most inspiring films that I've ever seen! The performances are simply amazing, the plot could be better, but even though it deserves to be known as pure art, due to the passion that Miles Teller transmit. The lesson I got from this is to never give up, to focus and to truly believe in our quality. Concluding, for me it's a modern masterpiece of filmmaking! Extremely recommended! 
 A film as intense as The Deer Hunter (1978) and as dialogue-less as 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Whiplash weaves a depraved tale using sounds just as much as words. The film climaxes with a moral question of monstrosity versus purpose built up with a paralleling story of a dueling student and teacher. While one transforms from golden god to relatable monster, the other morphs from innocence to sin. The ultimate scene depicts their relationship perfectly while leaving room for interpretation in what can only be called a moral mystery. The drums act as a metaphor for a normal humans ambitions and beatings of himself, while there remains an underlying sexual connotation to the film: sadism and masochism, is there a limit? And the same question can be applied to any theme, scene, line, or note in the entire film. Is there a limit? J.K. Simmons is a master in turning the iconic Fletcher from monster to human and back again. From the very moment, Fletcher walks in the door, Simmons exudes an aura of intimidating prowess, yet the viewer also picks up on a hidden humor, sadness, and humanity. Every award Simmons won, he deserved in what may be the most chilling performances since Day-Lewis in There Will Be Blood (2007). Miles Teller takes on more: a transformation from reliability to deprivation. Does he succeed? That answer lies with Andrew. Teller fully embodied the performance into the role of Andrew. Damien Chazelle orchestrates, directs, and writes. The sounds mimic the tensions, the tensions are splayed out for the viewer, and the writing is impeccable, picking up on the casualness in the father-son relationship (in the theater) and the intensity of the training. This cinematic genius combines music and visual to perfection as two sides of the same coin. This cinematic genius leaves the viewer so emotionally, mentally, and physically drained, he remains seated for the entirety of the credits realizing the enormity of what he saw, while picking apart the closing music for last glimpses of meaning. This cinematic genius was unfortunately cheesy. A clichéd story of a rising star. Can Andrew really be the best after one year? Maybe the movie is imbued with so much meaning, it forgot its believability at the front door, along with its measuring gauges so the viewer could know what was going on? Is Andrew playing well or not? We don't know until someone tells us. How many times do we think he's playing well until we're shot down along with Andrew? Simmons is our masterful visual cue subtly indicating when Andrew is a star or not. The movie goes south when Simmons is out. The film is genius with Simmons on screen. 
 Whiplash is about a young man who wants to be a drummer but when he gets moved to a higher class the teacher is a bully who will do anything to his students to get a good show. The teacher is played by J.K Simons who is absolutely incredible. His performance is intense and will have you fearing for the students but at times he can also be so cruel that its funny. That might sound like a bad thing but it definitely isn't. the music is also really good and you got see the young man, played by Miles Teller, get better at drumming as the film went along. Miles Teller also gave a very great performance, most of the time he was on screen I forgot he was acting he was so realistic. There were lots of shots of him drumming were it focused on his face and you could see how much he wanted to be the best drummer ever no matter what. Although Miles Teller gave a very great performance after the film had ended i didn't really feel i knew a lot about who his character except that he wanted to be a drummer, that may have been intentional to try and show that he didn't want anything but to be a drummer but I felt that his character wasn't all that fleshed out. Also there was a love interest in the beginning of the film who was really good but she was only in about two scenes and i wanted to see more of her. Also (and this is a really small nitpick) there's a dinner scene in the film that was probably my favorite scene in the film but it was way to short and I wanted it to be longer.I recommend this film cause it has amazing performances and is also incredibly well directed and well shot. 
 A lot has to cure about how great this is, Whiplash I believe has won best picture of 2014, That's the main reason why i said this has to be one of my best films I've seen in while, The film tells a story about Andrew (Miles Teller) going to drumming lessons, but before that... He needs practicing by himself, And In the reality of time and pace it takes so much effort to put all those aspects in a combination of exercises, Starting off with the cast, I loved what they do, I loved how they get prepared for something new and exciting, They are so glad to cast in a film when it comes to Whiplash a spring blockbuster hit worldwide, To represent on this film shows a lot of difference behind jazz music, Andrew does the drumming, one person takes his side when he gets the tone incorrectly, A few others have their brass, and some people got their bass on them, not leave out the piano artist behind it all,Now let's get to it! 1... 2... 3... 4, Music starts playing and Terrance Fletcher (J.K Simmons) occurs to the ensemble work he gives in place making it the way the band wants it to be, And the creative thing is this film isn't just about music, It's about other stuff as well... Like Confusions, Concussions, The Meaning of Life, And the Meaning of playing hard.You would see what i said from the trailers, But I'm not spoiling anything because In masterpieces like this hard working, brilliant task of filmmaking which doesn't deserve to be spoilt but trailers and scenes were worth watching if i misheard anything.The next move when making music is stress, fast movement, and correct tempo sure knows what it all says in this film, making the announcement an annual stride.Other Than That This is worth checking out if you haven't seen the film already, I loved how every actor in this film do so brave on chemistry shows how much I'm surprised, The story was unforgettable you will obvious remember this film because... Everyone Loves Music! And the director did an amazing job on everything else!Other than that I can't wait to do this... It's 10 out of 10, The biggest Blockbuster hit of 2014 which i didn't get the chance to watch when it first came out, I'm now happy that i watched it because... I don't ever stop Loving Films. 
 This erosion of innocent ideas, like The American Dream, is becoming more and more prominent, especially amongst young people. The success of Damien Chazelle's, Whiplash, is a testament to this. Miles Teller stars as Andrew Neiman, an obsessive drummer who is hell- bent on becoming a great musician. J.K. Simmons stars as Terence Fletcher, the muscled up old teacher who incessantly yells at Andrew and perpetuates his inferiority complex. A large number of High School and University students found this movie to be scarily relatable. Whether it was the memory of an intimating teacher/mentor, or the shared belief that socializing, relationships and 'fun', will impede on one's ability to achieve some kind of success  audiences clearly empathize with this film, and that may not be a good thing.(Spoiler Alert) In the final scene of Whiplash, Andrew and Terence have seemingly buried the hatchet on their old and troubled student/teacher relationship. Andrew agrees to perform at a Jazz concert, under Terence's conducting. When the concert commences, however, the first song that is cued to be played is unknown to Andrew. He realizes that Terence has sabotaged him, and he ultimately leaves the stage. After embracing with his father, who walks over to console him, Andrew returns to the stage. To Terence's bewilderment, Andrew begins playing the drums solo. The scene runs for a while, and as time moves on, Andrew's solo becomes more impressive. Terence eventually accepts Andrew's rebellious action and begins conducting him. In the final seconds of Andrew's solo, Terence looks at him. Although the frame cuts off just below Terence's nose, the film's prior exposition suggests that he either smiled at Andrew, or said, 'good job'. Terence then cues the rest of the band, and the film closes on a loud jazz cadence  cue: credits.This final scene has been a hot-topic of debate in the YouTube and Twitter-sphere. The debate rests on whether or not Whiplash had a 'happily ever after' ending or not. Should the audience be happy that Andrew made his mentor proud, and that he became a great musician? Or should the audience feel melancholic because of what Andrew sacrificed to reach his level of excellence? Has Andrew's story given the American Dream hope? Or has he demonstrated that it will doom you to live a life without happiness?Film critics almost unanimously agree that it was a bitter-sweet ending; Andrew became great, but at the cost of his youth, and possibly his moral compass. Amongst the University student demographic (my demographic), however, there seems to be a disproportionate number of people who interpreted the ending more so as a triumph of ambition and perseverance. For a story about a young man who pushes himself to the brink of implosion, this kind of interpretation should leave older generations wondering what kind of principles of ethics and work life balance their younger counter-parts are embracing.Do not get me confused, I think Whiplash is brilliant  too brilliant. If I am criticizing the film, then that is my criticism. I loved Whiplash. Many other young people loved Whiplash too, but I am beginning to feel that this may be indicative of a warped understanding of success.Films can be much more than weekend entertainment; they are a helpful way to gauge the psyche of a particular target audience. It is a shame that there have not been many social science studies that have attributed film preferences to specific human characteristics; it would be a very helpful variable. For example, if American Psycho has a large cult following, and millions of people still watch and love the film, would it not be fair to say that there are characteristics that the murderous protagonist, Patrick Bateman, has that most viewers within this demographic empathize with? I am not suggesting that these people are all secretly serial killers  however hyperbolic the connection, there must be something about a character or concept that people empathize with that makes the film so enjoyable for them. Similarly, Whiplash's Andrew Neiman must clearly have some element to his character's psyche that most viewers identify with. 
 Damien Chazelle directed this story of a talented young drummer (Miles Teller) at an elite music school in New York who is browbeaten mercilessly by his instructor (Dr. Emil Skoda, I mean J. K. Simmons). As unpromising as the material sounds, and as autobiographical, it's better than I'd expected.In the third act, Hamlet has this to say: "So again good night. I must be cruel only to be kind. Thus bad begins and worse remains behind."It applies, not just here but in all training camp films, whether it's the Marine Corps, the Army, the Coast Guard, Navy Flight School, or Harvard Law School. It answers the question: What torture did you go through in order to be successful. It's not often we see a drummer boy put through the wringer. And, man, does Simmons put Teller through the wringer, one organ at a time. Teller practices until he bleeds over the snare drum. And THAT'S not good enough.The typical arc of a story like this has the resentful tyro becoming more mature, tempered like steel, proud and manly, winding up with both the admiration of his mentor and the pretty girl he's been diddling on the side. Sometimes the mentor must die, as John Wayne did in "Sands of Iwo Jima." Not here, though. It's the Big Night, the finale, at Carnegie Hall or the Hippodrome or La Scale or someplace. Teller proves his worth -- MORE than proves it -- and Simmons finally gives him the okay, a big French kiss on the lips. No, no, just kidding. Simmons only smiles at Teller after the drummer's stunning performance.One of the best things about the movie is Teller's relationship with his girl, the earnest and sweet Melissa Benoist, a student at Fordham. They get along quite well, but then Teller calls it off because in his pursuit of perfection there is no room in his life for a woman's demands. What an ass. Yet it's an original touch, because when he's achieved success (or given up) he calls her to renew the relationship but she has to check with her boyfriend. Teller's default position is "put upon." He looks doubtful, sad, mournful even, without a real ability to project anger -- and the script gives him plenty of opportunity. J. K. Simmons makes the picture. He seems to have taken lessons from R. Lee Ermey in "Full Metal Jacket." He's abrasive throughout, foul mouthed and in your face. Nothing you do satisfied him. "That's not my tempo!" After he's booted out of Julliard or whatever it's called here, he bumps into Teller and explains why he was so nasty. He claims he was always looking for the next Charlie Parker, a legendary alto saxophonist, somebody who could absorb insults and humiliation and keep on charging ahead, just like Bird did when he started out. You can be pushed beyond your limits and become a genius or you can settle for having done satisfactory work, says Simmons over drinks. "The worst words in the world are 'Good job.'" The climax proves him right.Yet, what a dumb perspective, a hubristic paean to Narcissus. As the proverb says, the perfect is the enemy of the good enough. How much should be sacrificed in the search for perfection? Charlie Parker died of drink and drugs at an early age, and for every Charlie Parker there are one hundred thousand guys who are good enough at their jobs.The music we hear isn't classical or pop. Otherwise we'd constantly be hearing "O, Fortuna" (Ka-boom). Since drums are the featured instrument it must be jazz. And the jazz isn't really inspired either, I hate to say. It's certainly fast and LOUD enough but it's as if every member of the school band were aiming for Maynard Ferguson's excess. I don't claim to know much about music. I'm less familiar with diminished sevenths than I am with diminished fifths, but I know what I like. 
 The way the story was told is great, the value of the story is great too. But the worst part is, the professor has no respect in life. This is not battlefield, this is civilized, arguably the most advanced society of America. You are not fighting for life, you are just fighting for your honor. And when you give up every beautiful, meaningful relationship in your life for it, you are not fighting for your honor anymore, you are fighting for your VANITY. Do U know what's worth fighting for? When it's not worth dying for? ---- 21 GunsWell, the protagonist did not hurt anyone by making this stupid choice, but the professor did. And even after knowing that kid committed suicide, he did not repent on the slightest degree.Did you stay too close to the fire, like a lier looking for forgiveness from a stone? ---- 21 GunsTotally valuable story but totally bad value system. They are weak people from the bottom of their hearts. Well, the essential reason is they are empty. That's why they are willing to give up so much for things that are not so meaningful. Especially the professor, putting him in a rapidly changing society, who knows what kind of organization he would end up joining and what kind of thing he would do.
