 saw 24 hour ago Best Fest Sundance , last 24 hour done little think marvel film . really zero expectation going , heard buzz surrounding town , knew little film began . yet get word thought justice movie going try . First everything film stellar ; casting , writing , acting , directing , music cinematography came together tell incredible story . want say bit couple aspect . Acting , first n't know impressed Miles Teller lead Andrew Nieman JK Simmons playing Band teacher Terence Fletcher . great either lesser actor would shined . Simmons ' performance really reminded Gunnery Sargent Hartman Full Metal Jacket , except rather emotionally destroying rebuilding marine 18 year old kid . character could easily cartoony 2 dimensional Simmons gave depth whole film felt compassion even understood motif , even lay Nieman third act . Two scene bring core character line intrigued 24 hour `` word English language dangerous 'good job . ' '' ( thus titled review , sorry could n't resist ) . Teller 's performance , younger actor n't seen much must say played role like seasoned actor . performance wrapped find much drumming insane . Whilst watching intense scene felt like watching executed , time feel like fight Rocky , feel like watching get demolished , except emotional rather easier physical . Whether discouragement , socially awkwardness , single parent household , internal conflict , hubris , arrogance , time mental torture put , blew away . Teller reminded much much talented John Cusack charisma electricity connect audience . one thing must commend writing , often kind know movie headed movie stayed unpredictable think certain scene sequence scene play take hard left keep balance ( good way ) . refreshing , time thought bow film something disrupts `` go end '' . Sorry rambled , perhaps thinking get focused review , needle say film must-see get broad release . Great job involved congrats winning award Sundance , certainly earned . One last thing get attention wide release could see heightened interest Jazz , certainly film make even not-so musically inclined want throw Jazz record drown .
 good part : movie sensitively filmed . camera relentlessly explores every bump Teller 's Simmons 's head like documentary Greek sculpture . add lot feel movie wonderfully subtle way.Simmons Teller ( `` Studio '' band director , guess , protagonist young drummer ) great job . Simmons particular really nexus energy entire movie , owns role absolute precision.The music , 's actually music , well-chosen well-performed.The terrible part : Simmons ( `` Fletcher '' ) Teller ( `` Andrew '' ) essentially character film . Andrew 's dad not-really girlfriend secondary character serve remind audience actual human like . Andrew insufferable jerk , Teller amazing job maintaining ( mostly ) stone-faced , blankly insensitive look throughout almost every tense moment film . Simmons 's Fletcher superb sadistic maniac . 's `` intense '' `` volatile '' - 's psychotic monster.I 'm debilitated reviewer son talented young drummer , get see good drumming time . persistent trope film Andrew drumming hand bleed wildly unrealistic ; basically happen 're drummer good enough get prestigious music school first place . Everything else Andrew fancy school , upon examination , completely unreal . basically never talk complete non-entities band . 're like POWs , obeying maniac director unflinchingly ( except fail , 're abused ejected ) . son ( whose judgment trust 's also obsessed , jerk ) described silly drum `` competition '' `` three people ca n't drum shitty grind-core break beat '' . ( fair , liked movie . . ) OK , movie allegory , intended realistic . 's allegory sadist really help self-absorbed jerk obsession get better want ? ca n't find way sympathize . mean , speaking ? Finally , actually appropriate yet irritatingly obtrusive product placement ( pristine cymbal label , super-clean Zildjian logo Andrew 's stick bag , etc ) got pretty hard take ( truly weird ) ending.Go see movie everybody else think 's great , feel funny afterwards maybe review offer comfort 're alone .

Charles Dickens novel jazz drum student , possibly . anything even vaguely purporting based real life , um ... No.I 'm stunned . Yet another IMDb/Metacritic/Rotten Tomatoes gush-fest laughably bad , check page really believe 's got high praise.Excruciating nonsense .

Sorry , total crap make sad think average guy think Kenny G cool film hard-edged depiction high-pressure jazz school scene . First , prof would day rehearsal Terence ran , 'd dismissed immediately ( hard , apparently school n't tenure ) . next , jazz communication , conversation , thoughtfulness , big dollop joyful soul . drummer competitive mean-spirited attitude shown student would find extremely lonely company , nobody appreciates . 21st Century equivalent Mickey Rooney Judy Garland saying , `` know , let 's build show save town !

 70 , new genre film aimed black audience emerged entitled , 'Blaxploitation ' . genre primarily glorified stereotypical `` criminal '' behavior black neighborhood . Damien Chazelle 's , 'Whiplash ' , 's invented new genre primarily large coterie Caucasian male : 'Jazzploitation ' , set elite jazz program Julliard-like school higher musical instruction . white liberal film critic martial art enthusiast alike , enjoy exercise sado-masochistic shenanigan evidenced plethora rave review gracing multitude web page internet.Do n't ask critic rave film require Mr. Chazelle provide even modicum verisimilitude . 'm talking , course , Mr. Chazelle 's antagonist , martinet music instructor , Terence Fletcher , would even last five minute prestigious music conservatory , given vast repertoire sociopathic behavior . Oh wait'Whiplash ' really supposed like fable , Mr. Chazelle given passhe longer beholden 'conventional ' narratives.But even fable operate within somewhat realistic world . realistic Fletcher 's co-worker shrink ( afraid dare assert one bit ? ) realistic see Fletcher 's interaction supervisor ( also completely browbeaten ? ) Would administration allow person continually humiliate student , hurl ethnic gay slur , actually throw thing student , could result personal injury ( possibly subjecting school lawsuit ? ) . Fletcher clearly caricature , belongs army setting music conservatory . Nonetheless , Chazelle need character titillate u along way illustrate simplistic morality play , entail warning danger obsessive careerism.Now course various naysayer argue people like Fletcher seek bring best student utilizing 'tough love ' pedagogue real life must work within 'system ' 'pushing ' much subtle depicted here.The go Chazelle 's protagonist , Andrew Neyman , play obsessed drummer student seek get good grace ruthless Fletcher . Neyman played Miles Teller liked much 'The Spectacular ' . Since play drum real life , Teller pretty convincing playing drum film . Chazelle applies 'sledge hammer ' approach toward character 'Neyman ' 'Fletcher ' . Neyman want 'make ' 'any cost ' . play drum hard hand start bleeding ( various drummer posting internet deny 've seen case ) ; way competition , Neyman get bad car accident , STILL drag performance attempt play ( Chazelle seek prove inane point Neyman obsessed , 'll anything wineven mean playing seriously injured jeopardizing life ) . really , see anyone ? , since like melodramatic fable , Chazelle character ridiculous thing , seemingly get away ! Two third Whiplash plot concern Fletcher 's quest supposedly bring best student ( none really get know except Neyman ) . John Bleasdale writing CineVue find Fletcher 's diatribe appealing : `` razor wit , sheer outrageousness , inventive taunting vulgar insult appalling blackly funny . '' agree Fletcher 's insult appalling `` blackly funny '' ? Keep mind character come contact Fletcher , ego , point one oppose . Therefore , Fletcher get away saying anything feel like ( may call 'wit ' , reality 're simply one note monologue -- set variation theme ) .The second act crisis manifest Neyman kicked school physically attacking Fletcher . way back toward kind 'equilibrium ' Neyman agrees give deposition lawsuit eventually lead Fletcher 's dismissal conservatory.The Whiplash climax occurs Neyman Fletcher meet jazz club Fletcher playing Neyman agrees play showcase . turn ambush , since Fletcher arranges Neyman get without sheet music end improvising ( Fletcher demented 's seemingly willing sabotage entire performance get back Neyman know testified ) . Neyman run backstage arm good guy father suddenly summons courage come back play , dazzle , performing extraordinary drum solo . Neyman triumphed enduring humiliating set-up ? ! merely play Fletcher 's stratagem push beyond limit emotionallyeven mean must sacrifice dignity self-worth allowing mad sociopath manipulate again.In order accept Chazelle 's tawdry tale , one must accept convention melodrama . Clearly 's written heightened reality make point sadomasochistic relationship student teacher . Chazelle may ultimately view character distance correct moral upper hand , mirror Tarantino , reveling violence also attempting disdain . 'Whiplash ' machination end tawdry sensationalistic compellingly tragic.I would recommend 'Whiplash ' excellent cinematography course neat jazz music . 'll pas storydue clear , unrealistic melodramatic aftertaste .
 believer clichéd notion success come obsessive dedication exclusion normal human interaction , coupled mountain degradation , suffering , humiliation , physical torture , absolutely adore worthless pile clichés , stereotype , bankrupt cinematic idea . story young jazz drummer brutalized sadistic teacher interest spurring greatness one repulsive exercise sheer idiocy ever committed screen . watched watched , waiting valid point emerge scene torment , bleeding hand , broken relationship , hideous nastiness rest , end , get whopping nonsensical cliché fool could buy . J.K.

 Take cheezy D-list sport movie script complete cliché bullying , demeaning coach tormented , misunderstood athlete ( reality : narcissistic , self-righteous , arrogant , spoiled immature child need grow ) -- replace 2 character jazz music `` teacher '' drum student `` elite '' music academy . Neither character redeeming quality - writer thought creating complex , intricate character failed miserably . ending show pathetic truly . assume writer ( anyone giving film positive review ) felt reached great epiphany conclusion - n't . tired re-tread storyline completely proper context . jazz drum student music `` teacher '' soldier boot camp learning play drum physically demanding , super- human endeavor film try lead believe.In reality `` teacher '' glorified conductor think 's something special nothing destroy student desire passion . also admitted complete failure misguided goal creating another Charlie Parker . `` student '' equally self-absorbed rude excuse human . thing positive seems pretty decent jazz drummer - 's . Character absolutely ZERO going . 's completely disrespectful dismissive everything everyone else.This film ( along Birdman ) sum pretentious Hollywood excrement promote award show convince higher `` intellect '' `` artistic genius . '' one remember Whiplash Birdman embarrassing side note Oscar history ( remember Shakespeare Love , n't think - Google ) .
 ( biased educated review jazz drummer student ) give 3 point : -the movie entertaining ( wich major factor ) take seven : -The plot 100 % unbelievable.-The idea portrayed get better jazz drumming ( matter music genre musical instrument ) injure , suffer psychologically practice tension hands/arms exactly opposite playing/practicing jazz drumming is.The way get better practicing relaxed constant ... improving baby , solid steps.-There special accent playing fast hell mean considered `` greatest '' , also indirectly importance reading musical score , reality , jazz drumming lot feel dynamic , , creativity , coordination improvisation ( without reading musicl score knowing form song listening player interact moment ) .So movie fiction , tagged . thing relate reality considered caricature turbulent student-teacher relationship . Also considered good way show teacher student .

People getting brainless music every day ( especially jazz ) , n't surprise many people thought good movie . guess 'm angry bad piece garbage compared people gave bad review , waited come DVD , n't waste lot money seeing theater . would make great feature Mystery Science Theater 3000 's bad !
 Well acted ? Sure . Decent directing production values- yep ! Plausible realistic storyline ? . Shaffer Conservatory . Berklee College Music Boston used heavy big-band jazz , school become far vocational . None conservatory 's aware feature jazz curriculum , , certainly would major . music professor USA would job behaved way Fletcher , point , JAZZER would ever behave way circumstance . Jazzers confrontational competitive , would contradict everything stand . way musician behaved talked film even remotely accurate . Real musician REAL life , ESPECIALLY JAZZERS , brotherly . professor would never come another professor 's class take , would never physically abuse student yell way ( intense profanity , humiliation , gender-insensitivity ) . teacher would n't come insult entire ensemble EVER . would never audition manner Fletcher . would never focus much drummer , would put much emphasis stupid pointless competition . JVC Jazz festival , like jazz festival , label-people attending scout new talent like baseball scout . Labels overrun demo tape web link downloads , remark screw remember expressed purpose denying deal absolutely inane.I NEVER seen drummer get bloody hand playing fast : stick weighs 2 ounce smooth . Oh BTW , drummer never share stick . Sticks personal , drummer , music program , carry stick bag like woman carry purse . never seen `` alternate '' drummer ensemble page turner drummer . Big-band rehearsal 9AM ? joking ? 'd never get many musician class early behave like soldier bootcamp , WAY ! believe Andrew get tossed school , Fletcher , messed playing song competition ? Seriously ? Even though bloody car accident ? Maybe imaginary tale took place hell , would slightly credibility . Hollyweird NEVER portrays musician accurately feature film . powerful movie , n't make point carry type profound message n't portray musician music-schools accuracy . Im sure fooled lot lay-people .
 'll brief.Although soundtrack nice ( like jazz ) character story unreliable . , real music teacher character would as kicked school pretty quickly.So , 's kinda like `` Fame '' - jazz version take way seriously ! Also , J.K. Simmons character far previous 'Schillinger ' role . time - got ( Oz ) jail decided turn anger neo nazi tendency music.Bottom line ( IMDb requires least ten line ) - much much overrated .
 n't `` enjoy '' movie though n't fault fine acting . Movies successfully pitch alternate reality internal consistency make unbelievable believable . movie Matrix , many Sci-Fi flick , director establishes environmental rule character operate within framework . objection Whiplash focus extreme example behavior extreme make conspicuously inconsistent movie 's time place . extreme strain credulity nearly every key player . could n't take movie seriously despite fervent desire make case over-the-top effort / sacrifice people think take win . little / back story convince character would either act like , allowed act like , recipient action . 's caricature upon caricature . movie 's conclusion provided semblance redemptive believable cohesion really late found whole setup contrived .
 ca n't believe people rate movie highly ca n't believe crap nominated Best Picture Year . say glad n't win . 'm even sure glad J.K. Simmons Oscar . movie bad beginning end totally unbelievable . 'm musician n't even like Jazz , 'm sure music school would employ tolerate teacher like Fletcher . People would report much sooner portrayed movie . scene discredit film . instance , Andrew , student , auto accident , walk away hardly injury ( although car overturned ) make time music hall concert . Yeah , give break ! Fletcher sadistic prick , supposed believe moved tear talk former student killed ? Total nonsense ! really irritated Fletcher character surreal disgusting , Andrew , student , obsessed . normal person would quit least reported teacher , , endure `` drama '' `` glorious '' end . found solo boring , could n't wait get theater . went see horrible film nominated best picture . praise brave people wrote bad review ... movie deserves .
 ( mild , generalized spoiler ahead , worry . ) played drum Big Band 15 year , teenage year well adulthood . 90 % time another drummer , sharing duty . exactly scenario , naturally , intrigued movie . started promising . young drummer eventually invited practice prestigious Big Band . Many little detail depicted pretty much point.But begin describe disappointment unfolded screen . drummer band leader ( even band member ) display sorry behavior becomes tough endure . want raise voice band leader , place drummer band member , fail miserably stand . Instead , endure scene bullying manipulation , people taking lying , like prison inmate going boot camp.Only behavior shown worse . people movie desperately trying reduce length prison sentence . Instead , desperate acceptance , approval , prestige , fame . accept humiliation , accept put , stand . contrary . think alright . embodied whole twisted concept . society striving fame outside approval beat sort moral value . n't value important ? think stand , value defend value , people try coerce , manipulate attack ? see people brainwashed enough play along farce . Worse , even support way.If n't troubling enough , also puzzle overwhelming praise movie get critic viewer alike . really become morally degenerated cynical sort story worthy IMDb Top 100 Greatest movie time ? Let clarify , objection production value , actor ( well , bit ) , camera-work anything like . 's story 's told , important part far , all.Another thing : supposed depict act playing music together , joyful thing . Playing band celebration , give-and-take player , almost sacred highly social interaction . band leader good give advice , critique . develops people instead using people . motivates instead manipulating . inspires enthusiasm instead fear . leading , bossing around . movie , get everything wrong.Overall , 'm thoroughly disappointed movie several level . reluctantly give Top 100 movie lowest score , simply due overwhelming urge gave stop watching .
 admired cinematography acting , start , thought would great film . bullying violence started ... first episode shocking gripping , wanted find film leading . turned leading blind alley . sadistic teacher ridiculous stereotype , bleeding hand plain unbelievable , member band sat around watching reacting appalling abuse . method 'teaching ' would n't work ; big difference pushing student achieve violent bullying . idea violence aggression could lead student producing better music thing , would laughable n't sick . tempted walk watched till end , hoping kind balance note realism . Unfortunately , n't one final triumphant performance merely seemed validate cruelty . Yes , cinema audience clapped end , made stomach turn .
 expected film much saw . think music military discipline swearing , opposite . important drummer play drum fast ? important . think film made actor music editor music . disappointment ! also disappointing see film took Oscars Boyhood . sickening ! really would like add really expected film delivered . sorry would recommend film see . disappointing .
 contrary reaction phony film WHIPLASH:1 . Fake jazz : Jazz vehicle tell story , get jazz rather academic teaching big band/orchestral music , emphasizing arrangement perfecting technique one 's instrument . film could better scripted classical symphony orchestra university . Jazz improvisation interplay musician , seen small group context . Big band seen evident nowadays sporting event . solo hero 's mediocre drum solo film 's end.2 . Fake theme/ending : Theme movie importance motivation & rigor promote excellence , context student , pitfall martinet . movie , audience manipulation dramatic purpose theme often betrayed end , famous case Alec Guinness 's sudden reversal climax BRIDGE RIVER KWAI , audience expects damn bridge blown , even though character spent previous 2 hour every fiber symbolically building . WHIPLASH finale contradicts everything previously script , even-handed falsely convey message `` maybe '' true artistry achievement stem horrible inspiration 've witnessed . Totally bogus phony.3 . Fake character : Given jazz 's history , two major character - protagonist antagonist , Black . filmmaker every right make whatever want , perhaps female teacher girl drummer would interesting , also would fit use jazz movie 's central core . reaction whitened-up story reaction would '50s movie biography Fats Domino played Pat Boone , whose early career essentially spurred industry ( specifically record label ) customarily ripping Black artist ( Fats ) white artist ( Pat ) singing song general audience . crappy approach here.4 . Fake gimmick : Many gimmick scene WHIPLASH would blue-penciled made final script TV episode rather independent ( `` anything go '' ) feature film -the writer ' room would permitted slip . notable hero 's car accident arriving late bloody unsuccessfully try perform big concert contest , band 's drummer perfectly capable going stead . merely unbelievable farcical directed . Final reel conned appearing chart song never seen heard asinine gimmick , almost stupid returning suddenly lead orchestra , fake-dramatic purpose . maybe even worse scene made want leave screening : blow-off girl friend telling need practice succeed would leave enough time relationship continue . must looked bad page n't play screen.5 . Fake performance : praised J.K. Simmons many time , read rave review IMDb role obscure comedy NEW TOWN . facile , surface performance kind win award ( surely ) , pale comparison many others playing essentially role . merely cite Robert Duvall GREAT SANTINI Lou Gossett Jr. OFFICER GENTLEMAN vivid recent memory . found playing closer psychotic Humphrey Bogart CAINE MUTINY role called for.6 . Fake icon : Buddy Rich elevated god-like status WHIPLASH , reactionary outdated concept reject entirely . show biz history would nominate Rich iconic status jerk , musical artist . jazz history , logical icon role model would Art Blakey , since importance modern ( post-WWII ) jazz secure point became archetypal leader inspiration hundred musician graduated band , ranging formative stint Wayne Shorter Marsalis Bros. little-known connection artist varied Chick Corea Chuck Mangione , saw appear Blakey 's Jazz Messengers Boston 1966.. Unlike teacher posited WHIPLASH Dick Cheney-like nut , Blakey motivated rather tortured young acolyte . Buddy Rich mediocre '60s big band yielded nothing , drummer technique zero jazz.7 . Fake porn : Categorically WHIPLASH ( title perhaps key hint ) type soft-core pornography , among thing . 's another movie example trend recent year substitute sadomasochism traditional sexual porn - namely thousand horror film torture sadism appealing audience alternately identify hiss sadist protagonist , recently oncoming trend inspired success 50 SHADES GREY . movie 's domination theme obvious , submission aspect way subtle -masked hero 's natural rebelliousness . Looking beyond score submissives -his fellow band mate humiliated ( key element BDSM cinema ) throughout film . entertainment definition pseudo-porn , acceptable mass involve `` money shot '' explicit penetration making soft-core rather hardcore . absence sex WHIPLASH different absence actual sex BDSM exercises.8 . Fake setting : L.A. substituting NYC = zero atmosphere .
 face top unrealistic portrayal odd subject matter coach drive charge limit . message get little confused movie progress ... . psycho ? Pretty typical lot movie churned US day relying sensational exaggeration graphic language rather good story . drumming poor drummer Phil Collins . general public US must gung-ho accept drivel ... . loud mouth abusive jerk get Oscar give . warn ... taste disappointed !
 know ? `` asks film 's protagonist audience introduced Yeah 're Nazi dude enjoys raping new arrival Oswald State penitentiary . Yes JK Simmons back playing Oscar winning role n't different role OZ fan know . 's nice see year Oscar nomination heavily favour indie cinema . 's even nicer know film fellow member site pick crop 2014 film release sat back hoping get blown away itSo good ? Yes quickly qualify stating 's really masterwork people might claim . One criticism HURT LOCKER received could easily rework story someone become addicted adrenaline . Instead bomb disposal man could story involve fireman take risk 's WHIPLASH . brutal drill instructor trying turn weak civvies efficient killing machine ? 's already done hundred time 've reworking familiar story slightly unfamiliar setting music school . 's slightly predictable story order predictable 's plot turn involving situation become rather contrived unlikely say least stop falling apart director Damien Chazelle using tool disposal involving editing , sound mix cinematography disguise flaw story telling . Certainly many director nowadays think editing revolves around taking much cocaine possible mutilating coherent screen action . editing style WHIPLASH showy genuinely admirable time . 's nice actually watch film notice editing never irritated WHIPLASH one better film 2014 's probably film 's easier admire like . like n't love 'm great hurray watch
 Filmmakers paid positive review decade IMDb , ca n't think way IMDb protect false paid input.Consider WHIPLASH , film proved nothing limp box office , found anywhere top 100 2014 , yet 176,500 vote IMDb 10 , 9 , 8.Then consider unoriginal , badly acted , boring film.The hero want World 's # 1 musician . Fine ! get J V Simmons scream obscene language face play drum hand bleed ( Ridiculous ! ) Let tell course language . idiot excel . King size fool like J V Simmons character nothing else offer ; else-wise could communicate without it.The boy still go movie Dad . Sweet ! movie distinguish adding Milk Duds large tub popcorn blabbing show , making people move away.Later , master courage date pop corn girl take pizza . Wow ! add substance later scene dump need time music.There nothing original interesting going here.Whiplash one worst film 2014 . IMDb would much better kept honest clean . hope producer enjoyed $ 1.60 paid rent DVD , next time 'll think twice choosing anything Sundance .
 Hard rate film 's much like - performance , unusual story-line , fact 's jazz . Still stay liked least movie - fact Fletcher 's torturous reprehensible method seem validated end . really wished kid would succeeded spite Fletcher showed method cause irreversible damage sometimes even death . Abuse way make talent ( artistic otherwise ) blossom - McCartney , Spielberg , Federer , Bach , Evert , Picasso , Da Vinci - countless example genius without without abuse . Maybe jazz different ? doubt .
 'm giving Whiplash one star rating compensate rave review gotten people obviously know nothing music made , go great performances.Almost whole film relationship talented teen drummer , played Miles Teller teacher , played JK Simmons , directs jazz top music school . JK Simmons role sick meld evil Nazi WWII , brutal drill sergeant father physically mentally abusive . head shaved , wear black `` muscle '' shirt almost continually movie , scream student , us language make George Carlin seem like Mr. Rogers , throw chair , finally slap Teller character face , repeatedly . n't think minority group insult repeatedly , worst four-letter trash talk imaginable.The fact acting impressive ca n't save film . script terrible . disservice music education time support art already struggling.Worst , film misrepresents everything real music music education . Anyone seeing film thinking going music program first time would turned-off film mind-rape . worst kind damage one human inflict another name teaching without leaving great deal physical damage . nothing music , creativity , teaching . Hollywood worse.There abusive musical director way much power , fictional character would last one week music school . One student would simply turn I-pad , record go , pas around.The teacher would job likely jail.One reviewer called `` steaming pile excrement '' . Apt word .
 's one thing worse ludicrous , shallow , artificial movie , 's ludicrous , shallow , artificial movie everybody seems adore.Whiplash want love great art , actually hate great art . JK Simmons - brilliant actor - playing disgraceful character , stitched together completely unrealistic , inconsistent motivation action , conceived bludgeon viewer thinking 're watching something profound . casually toss assault , depression suicide way clueless , opportunistic director could . big finale would powerful made sense main character involved - doesn't.Even worse , finale leaf u unmistakable message : sadistic leadership way greatness . n't take kid see .
 Whiplash terrible , unrealistic movie . First , musical form popular culture , Jazz one relaxed organic . fact music director characterized disciplinarian reminiscent `` classical '' genre 60+ year ago ( Toscanini , Bruno Walter , etc . ) , musical director ruled almost fascist like iron fist . changed year ago `` classical '' music NEVER case Jazz . former professional Jazz classical musician studied top music school , creating great Jazz relaxing moment , frightened point cry evil music director.Secondly , within first 20 minute movie , music director throw chair student slap ! ! called ASSAULT , would NEVER happen ( point , tolerated ) , academic institution , minor major ! Certainly US ( New York City , case . ) alone completely discredit movie opinion . 's unrealistic piece crap ever made ! ! movie discredit beautiful art form Jazz insult teach play .
 way quite strange film virtually build-up ; start Andrew ( Miles Teiler ) playing drum minute eventual mentor Terrence Fletcher ( J.K Simmons ) walk observes Andrew playing drum . liking hears , Terrence offer Andrew place band ... .Not problem start Andrew point , 's point band first assemble started problem film ... next 80 minute Terrence Fletcher - man mystery ; know ? Well 's man seems sponsored Accurist , 's combination drill sergeant Full Metal Jacket Simon Cowell Nasty Nigel Lythgoe . majority film show band playing music ( admittedly initially liked aspect film , repetitive wore thin ) Fletcher shouting student , putting etc . thing moderately entertaining first 80 minute hearing Fletcher 's put down , 80 minute losing live . Think hearing Simon Cowell 's put down X Factor ; 's fun 5 minute , hearing 80 minute omnibus edition Tube would drive insane.The film even fails basic level ; n't entertaining enough make fun watch , n't fleshed enough make good character study social commentary part n't interesting enough keep involved story.There thing puzzled ; point Fletcher asking Andrew 6am Andrew turn late Fletcher ? thread opened without purpose . also loved fact Fletcher claimed knew Andrew made lose job Schaeffer conservatory music , given fact mistreated almost every student taught could possibly know Andrew dropped ? n't total shamble , least , fairly well made Simmons good respective role least render film totally unwatchable . Whiplash really come good final 15 minute 15 minute get revelation throughout 90 minute proceeded . rather unexpected watch Fletcher prepared sabotage big night show Andrew incompetent . see Andrew come back show u best drumming absolutely fantastic . 's pity earlier part film passion intensity last 15 minutes.Ultimately , meant show pressure show business 's also self-absorbed affect life , life others around . 's shame majority running time Whiplash tackle repetitive dull manner offer little insight , commentary entertainment . three aspect extent last 15-20 minute , case little late .
 film n't bad , nowhere near expected movie Sundance among many thing . Yes , JK Simmons fantastic , want know producer convinced Simmons nominated Best Supporting Actor category rather Best Actor movie . 's plenty picture . course , could n't Best Actor , 'd shoo-in Best Supporting Actor , spades.Towards middle continuing end , plot became ridiculous . Getting smacked oncoming truck car flip , running make concert ? Physically attacking teacher ? Going back play drum instructor despise , know certain song played , everyone else ? n't practice ... like ever ?
 music , character well . 's soul main character 's musical drive -- n't love music , desire fame . get rejected , go home take poster drumming idol disassembles drum kit . , might novice drummer , got let go asshole teacher 's band , would much happier continue drumming fun , accord . kid n't seem listen much except technical side drumming ( Buddy Rich ) , focus fast hit drum rather incorporate drum rest music . movie make seem like drummer supposed hog show , least celebrates end . Sure , kid `` pushing boundary '' , n't necessarily make good music make good musician.This without mentioning part detract realism , constantly bleeding hand ( n't think Charlie Parker Buddy Rich lost gallon blood session ) incredible one-hit KO snare ( 've tried , slightly le scrawny kid -- dice ) . two character movie . rest flat hardly notice . love interest might well left n't enough make care relationship , see 's kind arrogant douche boyfriend . Hard relate type . good performance two character , 's thing carrying movie . writing packed full homophobic slur quickly tire , unconvincing dialogue abounds.I like drumming , like jazz , respect musician work ass . could n't sympathize character . found superficial lesson ( `` 'Good job ' kill artist '' even lesson ) , could n't feel heart music . think people impressed well-acted shouting fast drumming `` artistic insight '' . creative music made , , despite hope wish , creative movie .
 spent entire life music playing drum teaching art , tell many thing wrong movie , 's laughable . absurd , over-the-top , face-slapping scene trailer enough avoid seeing . , urging friend - non-musician thought `` great '' , caved curiosity . taste movie aside , 's still friend , right initial judgement . Watching entire movie waste - made half-way ditched . `` Whiplash '' unadulterated load crap .
 Seems people like movie people know nothing music . film try get buy kind polished , elite fantasy world support belief success come great sacrifice . sometimes does.. movie absolutely ridiculous.People become musician LOVE art . n't pushed `` achieve greatness '' sadistic asshole teacher . Also , Jazz far le rigorous robotic movie would believe . Jazz ( Blues ) always self-expression - play , spontaneity , colour , contrast & emotion . Lots great jazz player self- taught never even went music school ( see Django Reinhardt ) . Many ca n't even read music.This ( American ) movie completely fails understand one Americas greatest cultural export . Brit , appreciate irony - conclude writer must total dipshit .
 's boring 50 Shades Grey , 's simplistic . two character , plus couple others hinted ( several second screen time ) .I loved music . acting good , role especially nuanced.The main problem within first couple minute film , know Andrew 's goal : elite drummer . Great . also realize instructor complete jerk ( worse ) going `` challenge '' Andrew . , rest movie , wonder whether 'll end overcoming challenge good drummer , whether 'll give up.It kept attention , would never watch movie second time . n't enough substance . nuance . nothing think about.The pseudo-philosophical , pop-psychological discussion movie whether abusive treatment teacher justifiable potential producing greatness pathetic empty.There shade side-story . 's paper-thin character girlfriend . exists make u believe Andrew might giving something pursuing goal , since Andrew n't likable , n't really care ended her.Anyway , movie n't really 1 star ... give solid 6.5 , since 's voted high IMDb , 'm trying bring realm reality .
 believe film received many good review . believe film Oscar nominated `` Best Motion Picture Year '' . 's IMDb 's synopsis film : `` promising young drummer enrolls cut-throat music conservatory dream greatness mentored instructor stop nothing realize student 's potential . '' film , however , bully music teacher insult , assault , slap , degrades , humiliates student death . Literally . film realistic sense depicts catastrophic effect bullying people 's well-being . Everything else film would simply happen . reviewer , music knowledge , explained music institution teaching practice method implausible , nowadays . psychologist verify bullying motivate person become greater . Peoples ' potential likely crushed consequence bullying . Victims bullying easily `` overcome '' `` harden '' become better human being . Moreover , victim bullying tend become bully , later life . , would claim film making bully.I big fan violent film felt emotionally exhilarated  completely satisfied  watching film like Oldboy , Sympathy Mr & Lady Vengeance . Whiplash left feeling disgusted , wondering kind people made , watched , enjoyed .
 plucky young drummer head big time crack pressure dictatorial band director , pushing come back greater height . sport movie , Whiplash effective . Unfortunately , n't really anything music ( reality ) , vision artistic achievement come unsavory undertone . Let 's consider second ludicrousness melodrama . music director would slap player , use abusive language , trash instrument way portrayed film . film fall apart question equation jazz big band , question whether becoming player Jazz Lincoln Center pinnacle achievement . film also never address racial context jazz , nearly unforgivable sin . 's whole mythos hold art effort effort abuse therefore abuse justified pursuit greatness offensive . Anybody 's ever tried get good anything met teacher like Fletcher , suck . movie stopped portrait toxic masculinity danger come bad boundary , would done job well . seems like filmmaker many people praising movie fundamentally admire Nieman enduring trial , 's disheartening
 like Hollywood dare cast young actor n't fit standard beauty . lead worked extremely well character quite frankly , think 's kept riveted . Adversity fuel , exhaustion merely obstacle path . actor 's nervousness receptivity mesmerizing entrap world . camera could pulled Lars Von Trier , standing behind shoulder would felt same.While audience n't courted much caring character , story bring emotional content theme appeal everyone . desire make something life , sacrifice , labour . know end ? 's different us.JK Simmons remarkable chemistry lead could better sufficient . enough hold movie together.Now bleeding hand great first quickly wore . Everyone one u 's ever played instrument ( everyone ) , know hardship n't playing accuracy . get main struggle keep fast beat said , bleeding hand metaphor quickly wore . trombone , would made lip bleed ? finger piano player ? much . Sweat would sufficed.Ups down - greatest movie 've seen year , good . Pretty good . 's 8/10 ; would recommend specific crowd .
 movie start drummer action band room end long , dark hallway . first encounter student Miles Teller Andrew teacher J.K. Simmons Fletcher . Andrew student great drummer , pizza joint girl name 1930s song playing drummer band . Attending prestigious private music school NYC springboard greatness.But knew Fletcher n't know wild man Fletcher . Seemingly control over-the-top criticism musician may little . using ethnic gender slur berate . behavior probably would never tolerated real school necessary resolution story.Paul Reiser good dad , Jim Neimann cute Melissa Benoist ( Glee next Supergirl TV ) Nicole , girl Andrew start dating stop say compatible drive best.JK Simmons Oscar Best Supporting actor movie running Best Picture . Many fan think `` Birdman . '' movie hard watch time pay final couple scene . SPOILERS : week on-again , off-again verbal abuse Andrew snap failing perform well automobile accident right performance . rush Fletcher stage , tackle , bloody , Andrew kicked school . family representative former student hanged convinced Andrew witness Fletcher 's behavior , terminated . accidental meeting Fletcher asks Andrew play drum gig , actually setting failure opening number Andrew know n't music . However next Andrew began play hot number , stood Fletcher , musician come , maybe Fletcher finally star .
 Really inspiration movie , felt like music student sitting pressure J.K. Simmons role , real hard way hang music hard life , till end . think shot perfectly depicted movie without losing intensity , special thanks J.K. Simmons . J.K. Simmons Miles Teller , character made movie powerful made audience kept toss.As really story experience best part beautifully screenplay made film stand crowd.Electrifying moment made felt 'm student band , fear play instrument proper number ... best Damien Chazelle , future assignment : ) movie one best liked movie recent year .
 widespread critical acclaim multiple award nomination win , found Damien Chazelle 's 'Whiplash ' rather thin clichéd regurgitation tired `` Driven artist , intense student/mentor relationship '' trope absolutely nothing fresh say offer up.I believe reputation primarily built upon strong performance two lead , Miles Teller J.K. Simmons . Though character paper thin , actor absolutely inhabits way add dimension n't page . impressive performance make wish much material level .
 poor little ambitious drummer bloodied precious hand - practicing JAZZ drum ! ! Hahahaha ... ..People buy ? Seriously ? ? ? Hahahahahaha ... . 'm even drummer , love kind music like people . JAZZ ... .causes bleeding callous finger , reading music note improvise ... LOL ... student serious issue ... .There excuse give film anything 5 research laziness technical fails alone ! brutality sell ! moral story , criminal level abuse justified , long victim ( sort ) survived it.I read `` Loved '' review curiosity . Found 2 school people praise nonsense high heaven:1 . FUTURE BULLIES -- -- school belief power hate brutality . name whipping hidden greatness young genius , damage child soul child grow perfect like murderous sadist hidden explosive pile would turn mental-torture bleed future child suicidal edge . 2 . Devil 's Minions -- -- class see abuse even happens baby infant .

 movie high Top 10 Over-rated Movies recent year list.Posh school authority act like mafia lord cause great psychological/ physical/ property damage - student free-est nation earth gut give third finger , laugh loud , throw back abuser , change school , make police report ... etc etc ? Instead `` good guy '' bleed get ... .approval ? pay high price get ... tiny little revenge victory ? Seriously ? moral ( ) story : justice - good people ( like poor little ) resign cowering performing tedious soul-destroying grunt work get breadcrumb approval . actor good emotionally convincing despite absurdity , production value high quality . 'm going mock general audience buying `` OMG getting music degree even harder qualifying dental surgeon ! `` .I fault Hollywood scaring potential big dollar music school customer especially overseas . Even militant tiger mom would think twice sending child American music college ! Oh . lol.Musicians - music school self-taught , classical pop , find two lead sado-masochistic professor-student interaction utterly ridiculous first , resigned laughing writer/director 's desperate attempt `` creating conflict dramatic tension '' , well , little . Musical craft boring , sustained repetition . rest , talent/ greatness , individual.What shock even pro critic high praise - cynic nature . shock people seem okay abused shamed scapegoated open , supposedly civilized place , work academia . conservative modern Asia , yes understand high rating movie , people resonate `` good guy '' `` endure '' absurd level undeserved abuse . West ? Really ? Integrity nice virtue paper . survival necessity . Financial survival , artistic survival . need lead respect , root . ca n't root one . even end attempted fix situation . may find heroic . little , late - . favorable rating movie probably saying ... 1 . Unreported criminal abuse authority USA academic institution under-reported2 . Stockholm Syndrome sufferer among educated adult world thought.Watch good acting performance , mediocre musical craft . Brace unnecessary cartoon brutality .
 movie terrible , unrealistic , top ridiculous waste time . redeeming part great orchestral jazz , character , story , well everything really , mean movie getting positive review . world would anyone able get away treating student like ? 's utterly ridiculous cr** believe even given approval made day human right anti bullying . disgrace . addition , found story predictable - sort like REALLY bad Rocky based music , except Rocky heart , soul relatable endearing underdog story . character totally unlikeable , unrelatable awful , care happens ? over-hyped horrible sad attempt movie making great opportunity totally missed .
 parody success achieve , would receive 10 star . Unfortunately high rating achieved baffle me.Firstly , let state understand music professional enthusiast 's point view.In opinion , movie portrays music mastery technical skill , following fixed ( slight variation thereof ) tempo . remove anything remotely positive involved learning teaching music . main character throughout movie involved inflicting pain others order satisfy ambitions.Secondly , character development back story . character came end movie beginning . change Andrew could play better ( yippe ! ) .Thirdly , definition success ( 'Great ' ) path . movie portrays success neurotic obsession ambition ( never music - never got feeling , always ) desire proving people humiliated wrong road ! wrong people ? opinion succeeding something requires true passion love . Yes pushing required along way , entire journey consists , feeling reach end would far cry sunshine rainbows.In brief entire movie consists sadistic instructor fishing student break method resembling whack-a-mole employed succeeding ( YAY ! ) .
 wooden film . viewer , really get know character . Nothing great come abusive teacher . Hitting student face , really ? . unclear JK Simmons ' character really . perfection ? way achieve perfection humiliating student verbal physical abuse ? drumming excellent . 'm musician 've never heard student bleeding drum . 's ridiculous . thing JK Simmons ' character cared tempo . Talk unidimensional . crucified student could n't determine tempo beat . dynamic ? interacting band ? script superficial lacking . People probably like film Simmons interesting character drumming interesting . 'd think brilliant teacher would impressive jazz pianist - another boring scene .
 Right bat , 'll want know n't typical Hollywood story . writer must skipped day one Screen writing 101 , forgot include likable main character . first moment teacher introduced , 'll quickly develop zero sympathy . Less zero , perhaps . , , antagonist . far , good . ignorant ill-informed opinion , main problem movie student 's character . 've already got clearly defined villain , somebody root ? seems start way , slowly morphs borderline bad guy , spell mentor . , one 's interest student hope break free psychotic teacher . day seeing movie , 's hard believe nominated Oscar . technical standpoint , well made featured good acting , story somewhat off-putting . 'm big fan J. K. Simmons , character abrasive , actually started looking forward scene without . Maybe screenwriter 's intent make u feel uncomfortable . , succeeded . Sadly , though , ca n't say life richer seen .
 film tell story young drummer u accepted prestigious music school New York . teacher strict , even abusive physically psychologically . story tell enmeshed relationship two evolve.The music `` Whiplash '' great . 's like going jazz concert , especially finale performance end . plot , however , like . teacher abusive , dy everything could stir rivalry hatred among student . worst thing film give time justify abuse . Abuse right , film allows abuser give twisted reason justify something wrong . really anger . Coupled fact student keep receiving abuse , evoked lot anger .
 hype around , went watch movie lot expectation . Especially n't seen movie drumming , least drummer protagonist . admit , little disappointed.Drumming art . One need finesse drummer . , movie , seems 'speed ' : playing fast tempo . Double time triple time . extent blood ooze body . definition good music ? n't maker film heard 'rests ' music chart . play play powerful indeed play.And Conductor Mr.Fletcher eye set drummer . see interact musician ensemble.With filth anger Conductor , one really wonder good music would ever flow band ? reminded great movie 'An officer gentleman ' . Commanding Trainer movie arrogant ruthless good reason . 'Whiplash ' .
 fact movie earned high rating audience understandable - end , bad sadomasochistic taste mass audience longer secret . surprise critical acclaim - seems critic n't gotten far ahead public write.As movie , grotesque , stupid sado-masochistic fiction , indulging bad taste low inclination viewers.Most sad thing someone bright might decide degenerative movie actually depicting reality try bring kind decay real life . side , actual maniac degenerate might see movie indulgence action . Well , probably understood critic positive review movie : ) 3 10 .
 've never quite understood 's become pejorative refer movie `` manipulative . '' Truth , u go movie manipulated . 's kind whole point . Writer-director Damien Chazelle  least evidence sophomore feature , Whiplash  master manipulator . movie sleek machine work bat around climax incites audience kind frenzy n't seen auditorium since Rocky beat Drago . 's viscerally thrilling , distressingly hollow.Whiplash star Miles Teller Andrew , aspiring young jazz drummer studying New York conservatory . Hopelessly devoted craft , kid catch ear school 's legendary instructor , Terence Fletcher . Played great J.K. Simmons auditioning lead R. Lee Ermey biopic , Fletcher bullet-headed , ball-busting martinet  emotionally abusive sadist almost super-villain proportion . recruit Andrew competitive Studio Band proceeds humiliate , badger berate new pupil brink nervous breakdown.It 's Fletcher 's belief Jo Jones n't thrown cymbal Charlie Parker 's head gig ill-prepared , wet-behind-the-ears saxophonist never would buckled become Bird . Fletcher throw lot cymbal , plenty stuff . 's generation raised participation trophy excoriates word `` good job . '' Fletcher demand excellence , matter many obscenity , homophobic epithet piece furniture hurl student get desired result.The sheer pleasure watching J.K. Simmons role understated . key utility player past decade 's film finally stepping spotlight , conduct temper tantrum mathematical precision , time diabolically lulling kid chummy sense security unleashing splenetic rage .

 Whiplash astounding piece modern day cinema . film leaf physically shaking even second watch complete sensory overload try reconcile every element film seems seamlessly passionately crafted . hope Whiplash overpraised sense future audience may meet harsh expectation come away underwhelmed .

 Whiplash beautiful movie show perception expectation young drummer experienced band teacher short tempered strict.Movie boring starting last half hour amazing.JK Simmons amazing Band teacher really deserves Oscar best supporting actor Supporting Role.Other cast also nice.Watch movie want fulfill dream matter much hurdle life.My recommendation n't watch movie higher expectations.Overall give movie 8/10 .
 enthralling thrill ride movie jazz . Yep , 's right . Andrew ( Miles Teller ) promising jazz drummer ambition best . Fletcher ( J.K. Simmons ) cantankerous , exacting , conductor Andrew need impress fulfil dream.The two lead perform brilliantly . Simmons launch Fletcher 's virulent tirade savage gusto , frightening demeanour victimisation promising pupil creating initial drama tension . feel Andrew suffers verbal physical abuse meted potential mentor . battle will develops Andrew determined simply accept every degradation heaped upon him.In interest tension drama , 's overdone . Whilst immersed event taking place , may notice . film powerful . afterwards , likely think improbable . Scenes Andrew father girlfriend feel superfluous , interrupting savage narrative battle Fletcher Andrew.It 's battle result event taking different turn . made see side . goodie baddie , 's tale two obsession conflict ensuing spark fly . reach dramatic finale ( spoiler ) watch unfold u like drawing back taught bowstring , wondering arrow fly.Excellent , gut wrenching , roller-coaster movie . Prepare accordingly !
 'Whiplash ' story two men . One young music conservatory student determined good idol , Buddy Rich , drum . single-minded pursuit largely ignores aspect normal , well-adjusted life , including personal relationship . primary character ( J.K. Simmons career-defining role ) hard-ass music instructor ever . curse , cajoles , intimidates physically assault student , buffered philosophy , never achieve greatness . Neither lead character yield , premise tension flow drama incredible jazz music .
 Never thought 'd like movie . Really love drum playing actually hoping Andrew would play one time ending , instead played Caravan . movie also great plot twist . Wow , learn human character anticipate person like Fletcher would felt betrayed . 's never really good . would revenge . Fletcher like male version Miranda Priestly Devil Wears Prada , severer . Ca n't imagine someone suddenly throw hard object me.Having watched movie got thinking n't done enough dream . feel small . Somehow feel Andrew obsessed . see hard practice everyday impress Fletcher , yet 's never enough meticulous ear . Luckily end happily , good price every hard work .
 absolutely riveting movie . Terence Fletcher ( crazy good J.K. Simmons ) Andrew Neiman ( Miles Teller ) amazing , although really , Fletcher took cake . character embodies fierce ( sometimes violent ) drive u , perhaps person life try push limit , make movie personal connects audience . hand , Andrew represents dreamer u , sometimes faced limbo attempting push harder give . make movie engaging . music movie , coupled drumming also add tension roller coaster movie.The finale also spectacular epic . 's basically nothing criticize movie . elevates simple idea diligence success whole new level engages audience throughout . 10/10

 Predictable Kirate Kid remake drum set . Besides cool drum-lines jazz performance storyline infantile . Ca n't Hollywood think original storyline . could predicted ending first 10 minutes.At various point descends comical farce , good way.It also sends damaging message everyone abuse teacher student end beneficial , end film defends support abuse.How film ever considered top 100 movie ever made beyond .
 Awful waste time . end result ( amazing drum performance kid ) could accomplished lot faster effectively positive reinforcement . way bald bastard teacher physically verbally abuse student plain disgusting . clear example exaggeration give story line greater climax . F # $ % ING TRUCK crash right car put phone car . shake injury ( bloody arm , head , face ) run class join Fletcher 's performance . acting ca n't taken seriously , instead pulled movie , Fletcher 's bad acting `` exaggerated '' teaching style made close movie 30 minute . Please n't waste time watching sensationalized rendition `` true '' event .
 fairness , probably n't write review give rating walked hour . many positive review film could n't wait see . movie like twilight version Glee . teacher throw chair main character , drummer ... thank God drummer ducked otherwise 'd dead . teacher physically mentally abuse Andrew . teacher would never allowed teach best music school country passion music , 's robot.It seems lot viewer equating yelling , swearing violence intensity great movie making .
 went theater watch Whiplash little knowledge film 's drummer.I enjoyed first 30 minute movie wondered direction going go . Obviously something going happen music instructor drum student ? movie ended primarily based around relationship , basically focused excessive practice verbal abuse . movie failed capitalize relationship drummer 's girlfriend , relationship dad fellow student . Two student drummer suffered abuse 'd think even though competing spot , 'd bond hatred instructor.The interesting scene dialog wise really family dinner funny yet short . Almost dialog film instructor yelling.The final 30 minute movie n't sit well . student instructor meeting bar talking drink unlikely seeing student hate man . n't believe student would 've given time day transpired.Then instructor , entire film 100 % set protecting reputation , intentionally tried embarrass drummer front huge theater also people connection industry . n't believe instructor suddenly would 've OK potentially negatively affecting already tarnished reputation ruin drummer 's chance student already made decision give dream.The final scene drummer instructor/conductor seemed come term also seemed unlikely.In end n't enough dialog relationship character n't go deep enough make great movie mind .
 13 November Whiplash  directed Damien Chazelle starring Miles Teller J.K. Simmons  premier Netherlands cinema . movie ambitious talented drum player dominant , relentless teacher , expected well , based positive reception many country several festival . Even release movie opened Leiden International Film Festival , LIFF Indie Competition . General appreciation also shown IMDb , film score 87/100 4400 votes.The story movie brings forward new . Andrew , young drum player , enrolls high-class , well-reputed Shaffer Conservatory , meet Fletcher , infamous teacher working high standard non-compromising method . Andrew attracts attention struggle two character begin Andrew secures position first drum school band practicing national school competition . movie focus two main character , way interrelate aim realize best drum performance school 's honor , prestige ego.Although movie excels cinematography , acting music  provided least like level jazz music  story n't seem convince . strict focus two men sole purpose lead repetition narrative , following cycle insult pressure teacher , hard work pain student , short-term victory performance succeeds . Even end movie , thing seem turn around , teacher try push student great performance , indeed delivers.Additional character , student 's father , girl friend musician school , support main story . never get depth background , role minimal ; underline determined ambitious Andrew really . school function decor , musician extra 's sign board , teacher school infrastructure.Focusing one aspect human relationship produce interesting compelling movie , Whiplash good example . Besides elimination surrounding factor , another possible reason story n't convince . general idea underlying story real talent blossom hardship pain . Consequently , message delivered good bully mistreat student talent , get full development . mind message true , least always , need justification flat , straight story two egocentric men struggling power recognition .
 People may quickly picture Whiplash Full Metal Jacket jazz band : 's Fletcher militarily pushing student , Andrew , get task right . hatred towards mentor becomes character 's motivation achieving order perfectly ; similarity could end . Although different context ; harsh , shout-y discipline sometimes negative human effect quite reminiscent . without grim twist , movie stick directly one 's determination successful job , either instructor . one rough environment take relentless study intense rehearsal intense discipline reach point goal lose control . like sequence , Whiplash keep viewer comfort zone , lead rewarding results.Movies like , specifically relationship student mean teacher , conventionally end heart changing sentiment , possibly leading two unexpected life-long friendship , Whiplash take stone-cold ; hardly showing sign friendliness bond . way young drummer gain light roll punch learn exactly band want , even cost much life . supposed image inspiration , film mostly portrays nightmare `` never give '' ambition ; transforms dreamer mad man step away breaking . Nonetheless , unending pressure brings real impact lesson movie trying show.The filmmaking spectacular , musical scene make truly grandeur show , core one mainly drum . impressively played relentless intensity , camera strikingly display flowing literal sweat blood drummer ; indicating committed exhaustion . performance spotlight , especially J.K. Simmons done perfect character . might easy overacted performance , Simmons find sense humanity beneath 's written , making Fletcher reasonable furiously shout intolerable flaw student . Miles Teller also killed , recognizably drumming part , aside , convincingly follows character 's obsession , turn closer insanity.Whiplash often feel cruel , important reason . depicts serious way motivation , feel every beat terrifyingly breathtaking drum performance ; mostly reality unstoppable desperately aiming , plus driven fear hate . eventually , film make clear point world music bitter . Overall , work choosing clever direction , staging magnificent musical set piece , remarkable acting two lead . Even story quite simple , heart tends overwhelm .

 Whiplash young man want drummer get moved higher class teacher bully anything student get good show . teacher played J.K Simons absolutely incredible . performance intense fearing student time also cruel funny . might sound like bad thing definitely n't . music also really good got see young man , played Miles Teller , get better drumming film went along . Miles Teller also gave great performance , time screen forgot acting realistic . lot shot drumming focused face could see much wanted best drummer ever matter . Although Miles Teller gave great performance film ended n't really feel knew lot character except wanted drummer , may intentional try show n't want anything drummer felt character n't fleshed .
