 start ; one film kept quiet whole 5 min seeing . literally could n't close mouth , yet n't sound coming . Oldboy impact word little describe impact . Therefore film definitely top 3 film ever made . belongs massive ingredient lot film seem miss ; divine plot . Even though acting screenplay world class , plot really cherry cake.When come screenplay Park Chan-Wook unique ( least western standard ) way filming . colour vivid seems like wanted every shot piece art . One tip : like shooting 'Oldboy ' , look 'Sympathy Lady Vengeance ' , third part Park 's revenge-trilogy . 's even superior camera-work 'Oldboy ' . n't , however , expect story like Oldboy 's , would disappointed.When come acting music , film also one better film ever made . music stick head every time put Oldboy-DVD theme-song come , 'm flooded good memory ( even though plot n't single reason happy ) . character also presented well outstanding cast . Especially Choi Min-Sik Yu Ji-Tae set convincing performance . really appreciate film respected , place top 250 . , however , would even higher ranking . n't see film like 'The Usual Suspects ' 'Memento ' , fantastic piece film-making without doubt deserve place top 250 , higher top 250 'Oldboy ' . serve cause ; fantastic plot . plot ca n't stand shadow even come close plot 'Oldboy ' . one reason two film better known western production company . living Asia , doubt 'Oldboy ' would top 20 time . advice people n't watched film yet : Go see ! definitely must- see . weak stomach , pull together still watch . n't shallow lot people tend .

 Armond White NY Press called `` virtuosic stupid movie '' . think 's exactly right.Certainly movie look fantastic . liked surrealistic touch . think director real imaginative way capturing process memory -- 's extended flashback 3/4 way think well conceived shot anything 've seen . acting standout . Hell , even liked score.But movie almost aggressively make sense.SPOILERS Leave aside moment obvious plot hole , large small -- although 's worth noting 's whole lot . Leave aside contrivance , : endless special gadget bad guy come need , rather magical view hypnosis , Dae-Su 's magical new ability , seeming omnipotence badguy . Let 's assume beside point , 're supposed take movie le symbolically ala FIGHT CLUB ( probably closest reference ) .The movie n't make sense thematically , either . 's really ? virtue keeping mouth shut ? movie seems suggest bad guy 's sexual relationship sister fine , problem seems Dae-Su 's big mouth . movie rather laboriously teach : sister kill rumor somehow sister belief true ( ? ) ; Dae-Su becomes convinced , fact , fault ; Dae-Su cut tongue ; Dae-Su pleads Mi-do never learn truth ; Dae-Su even end brainwashing via hypnosis forget truth -- `` keep mind shut '' , sense . mean , huh ? pretty juvenile kind ethic , blunt . Although Dae-Su protagonist movie really n't seem side . also hint weird kind passivity : hammer swinging octopus eating , Dae-Su n't really much : thing done , eventually begin internalize abuse given him.Is futility revenge ? One would think , particularly reference COUNT MONTE CRISTO . leaving aside notion Dae-Su 's tormentor 's omnipresence seems weigh notion Mi-do anything , really , take lump try fight back , fact Dae-Su considered movie really `` done '' something make critique pretty complicated . Remember , COUNT Dantes true innocent . motif pure revenge ever get -- 's Dumas 's ultimate critique , ultimate notion revenge even Count wrong work well . force seen isolation . , though , seems case Dae-Su learning `` bad '' really . n't take revenge really fault.I guess could argue movie show revenge futile bad guy 's point view . watching Dae-Su ? Maybe point everyone feel righteous realize true dimension `` sin '' . n't see lot people facing fact movie : see lot denial , fact . Dae-Su admits relatively `` minor '' sin ca n't face `` major '' one.After saw read interview cast crew , apparently vagueness intentional -- 're supposed left unsure . Well , movie successful , think 's unworthy goal , abdication artist 's responsibility . People bristled charge movie nihilistic , really point , movie 's supposed throw 's hand say , `` hey , dunno , figure '' , truly nihilism.Ah well , could go , wo n't bore . virtuosic stupid movie indeed , think : often amazing watch underneath surface whole bunch muddleheadedness .
 Oldboy take hammer `` batter '' American equivalent , leaving pulped chewed squid . Park Chan Wook display America miss ultra-stylish , ultra-violent thriller . watch Ben Affleck fail spectacularly summon displayable talent , Min sik Choi serf memorable role disturbed , vengeful Dae Su Oh , second Vengeance trilogy . Park skillfully creates compelling plot guessing entire film , final shocking revelation . Cinematography expertly done Jeong-hun Jeong , also worked follow film , Chinjeolhan geumjassi . Everything film done style panache creates memorable experience , many memorable scenes.Many people accuse film `` unrealistic '' . people forget film , documentary . one complains Star Wars unrealistic , rightly . Films right stretch reality , n't forget reason entertaining.Although film strong violence graphic nature , advise watch , broaden perspective world Asian cinema .
 feel compelled defend film quite frankly unwarranted criticism . Although n't without flaw , film , certainly n't one star film.What film ability sublime , shocking , ridiculous , mildly amusing visually stunning feat film.The sheer scale comment suggests film get one way another . film far away Maborosi get yet film great piece cinema . wont divulge plot end comment Latin quote reinforce self importance 'll say go watch , preferably 're squeamish n't mind subtitles.This film left thinking following day normally good thing ( atleast show memory working ! )
 movie awful , plain simple . probably revered see `` film '' `` movie '' therefore feel sorry limited understanding theatrical brilliance film , secure enough intellect say boring , self-aggrandizing painfully drawn-out movie waste two hour nine dollars.I suckered seeing inexplicable good review receiving came theater thinking review written over-excited film student aforementioned group individual shun regular movie , perhaps fear may actually enjoy one someday.The storyline quite promising one - man imprisoned 15 year , never knowing captor crime . abruptly released given five day discover identity reason man imprisoned . However , great concept soon disintegrates pathetic joke Oh Dae-Su run around beating people , trying sex young girl attempting use toilet eating live , writhing squid ( presumably dramatic effect , absolutely reason ) . trying figure horrible thing earn fifteen year jail , finally find ridiculous major letdown . nemesis , man supposedly went school young man , look like Banana Republic model twenty year younger . Hey , know prison hard Oh Dae-Su , much ask find actor look bit closer age ? thing wrong movie , one seems like easiest one fix.And big secret - one kept seat 90 minute could something productive - joke plot line involving incest rumor started high school . Come ! Throw u bone - really best could ? sat stupid dialogue , over-acting , gloomy set gratuitous violence ? ( way - 'm violence film seems fit story , case seems forced watch hero knock someone 's front teeth cut tongue pair scissors order distract figuring wasting afternoon watching pretentious piece garbage ) .Take advice - something else time money . take nine dollar go see lowly `` movie '' - one might actually enjoy .
 Yes twisted movie plot unravel slowly sometimes scene slow . 's incredible . symbolism behind scene stunning . go deep appreciate . lot gore violence turn , simply amazed depth width scenes.Without giving anything away , main character released meet man dog . 's seems irrelevant scene , put cage 15 year think would act ? happens man ? n't also cage ? n't ? symbolism man ? dog ? Revenge main character movie life . ? n't question know happened . n't question either.To one greatest depiction Oedipus Greek character 've seen decade movie . Nothing new . liked `` Requiem Dream '' `` Blue Velvet . '' Consider one .
 Old Boy suck ! , wait , let rephrase : Old Boy stylistically challenging , highly innovative , ultimately hollow repugnant exercise genre film-making . let know 'm coming  'Sympathy Mr. Vengeance ' brilliant ; unforgiving touching descent doom . movie everything happened somehow . One action triggered next one experienced vicious circle violence revenge . character seemed trapped situation.In Old Boy protagonist also trapped , know story , wo n't tell . 's room great sound design camera work . free , complication problem multiply . plot first close incomprehensible stumble one situation another . villain explains scheme end brings enlightenment , could n't care anymore . intriguing premise destroyed revelation 's contrived revenge plot bad guy.And contrived . story work inserting endless flashback ( full bad pathos ) explanation . keep audience interested , get gruesome scene murder , self-mutilation general mayhem . others remarked , scene well done , serve greater purpose . 's so-what comic extravaganza.Out 'Old Boy ' got small pleasure lot disappointment , courtesy one interesting director working today . liked ( among thing ) infamous hallway scene , actor , fight bodyguard , revelation Secret sequence Oh Dae-su leaving bad self behind end . Small pleasure , indeed .
 movie horrible . n't find plot line exact order 'm laying , end happened : Basically Incestuos Brother sex Sister . school find Main Character see , Sister kill herself.Fast forward many year later , Incestuos Brother Main Character 's wife murdered , Main Character kidnapped like 10-15 year . MC eventually released idea , captured . meet Young Girl , fall love , sex . find Young Girl Main Character 's daughter . ( yeah know pretty gross ) Incestuous Brother angry Sister killing Main Character went told entire school forbidden relationship . 's held 20 year long grudge , murder MC 's wife , lock guy decade , orchestrates sex daughter ? ? ? ? ? ? Seriously , completely turned movie point ? n't care sad bizarre life , desperately need latch oddball art , cinema , music make feel unique different everyone else . 's really nothing enjoyable movie cinematography . Every plot `` twist '' get disturbing overly complicated . good plot twist leave viewer going `` wow , n't think ? '' `` OMG kind sick % # @ $ % would even begin think ? `` acting sub par , character lame . Main Character run around talking claiming revenge entire movie . OK , think everyone follow line thinking . Someone took away family , kidnapped long time , yeah 'd want go bash skull . every time actually act revenge wimp instead killing fool let go attempt unravel overly complicated mystery behind done . Incestous Brother smug , cocky , stereotypical evil genius entire film . role thats done million time yet fanboys raving DEEP character . Please.And n't get started action , lack . Every fight scene : Guy miss main character right hook , MC punch . Another guy miss MC right hook , MC punch . Every stray dodge right hook , counter punch sequence occasional : guy swing delicate piece wood MC shatters wall , MC hit hammer . lame.I seriously angry wasted couple hour watching even angrier high rating IMDb . movie ridiculed crap .
 comment meant mainly warning people might attracted title ( temporarily ) high user rating find frankly puzzling . reason n't like title following:1 . directer must doubt whether make Jackie-Chan-type flick dark Oedipian tragedy . result , term genre , film fall two stool , tragic comic element clash cancel rather make harmonious whole.2 . character ' motif behavior incoherent unconvincing . Psychological truth logic sadly missing.3 . Absurd casting . n't blame actor , hard thing create convincing character acting alone , scarce logic script . However , apparent age difference 15 year leading two actor , whose age film ca n't differ 3-4 ? 4 . film poor entertainment primarily point 2 . ca n't find character could sympathize hard follow story interest . finally learn reason happened main protagonist , turn make sense.5 . film apart entertaining also thought-provoking . seen film , began wonder whether thought director tried provoke incestuous relationship could perfectly wholesome delightful . put construction ending . 6 . film rife totally unnecessary violence . Violence film ( elsewhere ) good thing , serf important worthy purpose . Purposes different n't want enter broad subject . Let say n't object violence film `` Saving Private Ryan '' , `` Passion Christ '' `` Pulp Fiction '' . `` Oldboy '' scene torture suffering prolonged graphic ( aural ) . ? know . Personally , n't derive satisfaction watching teeth extracted hammer hear man cut tongue scissors see choking blood etc . etc . 7 . film reminds little Japanese porno mangas fixation incest young Asian girl ' panty , urinating like . appears minority actually enjoy kind thing . 're one , might find film enjoyable.In short , recommend film either entertainment `` food thought '' . n't silly , disgusting . n't waste time .
 seems viewer assume thing make viewer dislike movie graphic violence . fact violence , disturbing cartoonish , last `` Oldboy '' 's deep flaw . character unidimensional , underdeveloped , primitive . `` intensity '' , obsession goal director , served cheapest mean . Let 's confuse mindless shot adrenaline artistic worth . end movie , seems card exhausted script becomes almost inadvertently funny effort find new level `` horror '' , continue `` shock '' audience already numbed plethora dumb soap-opera `` revelation '' already served big bunch . would hard imagine anybody even vaguely familiar masterpiece last fifty year Asian cinema enthralled pompous piece trash . Imagine Homer Simpson hesitating front cinema theater : `` go buy five cone ice-cream money ? '' smart , Homer , go ice-cream .
 sorry rain everybody 's parade . little background : like know lot Asian cinema , especially Japanese , Chinese Indian . Admittedly novice come South-Korean cinema , best best , sorry . want know narrow-minded come appreciating foreign movie fit stereotype `` dumb American '' . . . well , perfectly.I believe high praise piece nothing bestowed upon . disgusting *and* ludicrous movie . Hammy acting - everything badly done overdone , like begging uneducated viewer 's attention . Horrible camera-work , insistence meaningless close-ups derived MTV aesthetics.The plot full hole gigantic piece Swiss cheese . Nobody expects thriller 100 % realistic , sake entertainment 'd happy close eye small unfitting detail . , excuse , 's happening *can* stand even summary scrutiny ? story unbelievably intricate contrite act revenge worse worst tabloid story one read line supermarket . ( n't want spoil `` enjoyment '' , 's word , wo n't go detail plot . ) fighting scene violent , unbelievable , downright stupid ( main `` hero '' taking dozen dozen opponent time , trained imprisoned , punching wall ! ) truly `` outstanding '' feature movie two : lurid incestuous sex ( brother sister father daughter , well , 've evolved since Oedipus , n't ? ) graphic violence . cut body part - hand , teeth , tongue - together industrial quantity spilled blood ( many ten thousand tomato die movie made ? ) esthetical function/motivation whatsoever.A feast & inclined , admittedly , , even , feast merit subtlety . Heavens , even Mel Gibson 's recent much-discussed work almost similar theme n't bad.The invariably good press pretentious , overblown , overlong piece gratuitous gore coming Korean shore obtains make wonder 's happening . n't think ultimate paragon taste often ready accept movie n't enjoy may better able perceive . However , scruple whatsoever calling one see : bad , bad , bad . redeeming quality . 2c ? Find something better time .
 Hi ! South Korean national student London , would like give clue main character , Oh Dae-Soo , kept private prison exactly 15 year ate live octopus hope understand film little better.Firstly , wife killed one year kept privately run prison . Obviously , Oh Dae-Soo n't kill suspected murdering . must done Lee Yu-Jin planned sister 's revenge upon Oh Dae-Soo . South Korea , criminal unsolved crime including murder case forgiven/overlooked law 15 year crime committed , mean murder suspect would n't charged get punished unless suspect caught within 15 year murder . Oh Dae-Soo released 15 year wife killed . Thus , would n't disturbed police investigation Lee Yu-Jin could play discretion.Secondly , nobody country eats live octopus like way ate film . seems scene show uncontrollable anger man talked phone n't say anything reason kept prison . piece cake bowl rice front , guess would probably eat way octopus . , please n't get wrong eating something alive part Korean culture . understood extreme context.I saw film several time friend . n't quite understand first view came like second time 's one favourite . like complicated plot shocking ending . 'm studying translation English Korean , classmate friend English spent time South Korean liked one among Korean films.I hope talk help .
 age American cinema biggest blockbuster based film already successful overseas , one movie need seen American movie goer . movie got hooked Asian revenge film . Oldboy original movie show happens man 's freedom taken away n't know , . sudden thrust back society must track person took away freedom . Along way come multiple plot twist surprise n't see coming . 's shame many American film goer refuse see foreign film , movie genius . know , maybe someday movie get remade audience U.S. main character played Mel Gibson Bruce Willis . want stay true Asian vision , even think Jackie Chan could candidate .
 Unbelievable . `` Philosophy '' . `` Depth '' . `` Genius '' . `` Masterpiece '' . People must seen another `` Oldboy '' one 've seen badly written , poorly conceived , over-the-top-acted , sordid piece `` Kraapola '' , even ignoring moment ludicrously violent scene make unsuitable eye child , could barely satisfy imagination thirst plot consistency seven year old.The `` depth '' sorry concoction exhausted one little piece wisdom , `` Laugh whole world laugh , weep 'll find alone '' , type boring fortune cookie saying great author , Shakespeare , point IMDb , Kurosawa , would thrown garbage second thought . movie landed , would n't live era cheaply shocking perversely disgusting confused used named `` great art '' . short , yuck.2 100 . 's 1 1000 occasionally expert camera-work . way enough save infantile failure worthlessness , though .
 ***minor spoilers**I laugh see people calling work genius . character cardboard set piece sandbox weak writer . `` Hypnosis '' frequently used device cause main character act sans mental phenomenon . ( hypnosis memory n't work like way suggested , movie version concept deus ex machina different label ) room narrative control character development little conflict man environment story , slightly average fight scene unconvincing . ( 's comic book universe one man take 30 50 however many people training shadow boxing earlier scene ) reference `` Count Monte Cristo '' ( rather acknowledgement borrowing tradition ) , obvious parallel , example protagonist learns watching TV 15 year , Count Monte Cristo book wise prison companion . 've essentially added one big twist basic story way make work drain character meaning.Decent acting Min-sik Choi ca n't save one.6.5/10
 `` Oldboy '' best average movie , worst crashing pretentious bore . Overall , n't execrable , 's barely remarkable way either - poor taste amateuristic cinematography . However , broader cultural phenomenon Oldboy least fascinating movie per se . obscure , certain extent , amusing cult created around thankfully forgettable thingy . Like fanatic 's mantra , meaningless adjective superlative ( `` best fight scene ever '' etc . ) ceaselessly thrown ignorant audience , repeating something untrue ad nauseam would make true end . doesn't.Among equally thoughtless thought , one read n't convinced regurgitated piece ridiculous Hollywoodiana - repackaged `` worthy '' ambassador Asian cinema ( ha-ha ! ) - would culturally narrow-minded unused subtitle movie ! Oh yeah , good old-fashioned P.C . One call American bad movie bad movie , one call horrible foreign movie bad foreign movies.Reality check : precisely background foreign cinema interest awfully over-hyped `` Oldboy '' begin . already seen hundred foreign movie subtitle problem . problem Oldboy foreign movie , bad movie standard , subtitled dubbed , Korean American , Asian Western , yin yang , theatrical edition director 's cut ( tongue pun , , unintended ) . 's nothing remotely redeemable epitome mediocrity movie , one thank educated IMDb contributor public service offered warning audience inextricable mess getting .
 Fortunately , n't seen film movie , big screen , small screen video . doubt would able sit film cinema watch violence present film . watching first 30 minute , became disappointed curious.Disappointed hard follow story line , hardly understandable screen , huge amount aggression - still n't know shown Daesu ( main character ) pulling raw teeth another person , beastliness woman , cutting tongue . also curious , see film say conclusion , ending summary brutality.Unfortunately , though movie boring , n't get answer cruelty watch beginning end . opinion , want blood want laugh , Kill Bill 1-2 , want blood meaning , take recent war movie , want Eastern movie , much better title . Afterwards take rating Cannes film festival precaution , Oldboy got lot praise jury , much say 4/10 scale.I hungry see something beautiful , harmonious , true feeling clear message .
 Oldboy one intense movie ever see . Breathtaking , brutal easily one best revenge movie ever made . acting amazing , especially Choi main protagonist Dae-su Oh . actor great performance powerful emotional ( need see infamous squid scene ) . Chan-wook Park give movie unique style direction . plot start like fairly standard revenge drama slowly make movie darker series beautifully shot flashback huge scene involving nothing family photo album.If ca n't handle extremely strong violence , torture , sex language ca n't stand subtitle 's best stay far away Oldboy ... .if , though , watch ! 's incredible movie best performance , moving score disturbing unique plot twist twist.5/5
 movie expected . thought 'd seeing intriguing mystery , revolted rather captivated . Eating live animal , impromptu dentistry claw hammer , incest , self-inflicted violence visual atrocity one must watch Oldboy . Add ending movie , beyond pale perversity , movie experience never forget wish could . Overall , wish never seen unless enjoy extreme , gratuitous violence , implausible deranged story line would test strongest stomach , skip . high rating site inexplicable .
 Jove , unholy mess ! Revenge , incestuous love , mechanical games-like fighting , ceaseless utterly unnecessary violence , primitive `` music '' hammering away bewildered victim , big `` surprise '' ( actually tend `` revelatory '' National Enquirer 's headline ) . Add shoddy camera movement pretending stylish creative 've already impressed crowd . movie 's totally undeserved popularity powerfully indicates low level pop sub-culture succeeded achieving last decade , also imposing dominant taste impotent audience . ( far deeper insight human sufferance mental sickness , without `` Oldboy '' vulgar excess , recommend older Dutch/French movie , `` Vanishing '' . ) Well , n't believe 's absolutely nothing good say movie . fact . ( ) famous scene hero ( really `` hero '' , abject father sleep daughter attempt obtain forgetfulness rather redemption ? ) eats live octopus benefit greatly vivid presence best actor entire cast : octopus . bad poor beast , eaten , could n't survive one act order obtain yet another worthless diploma , `` best actor '' , Cannes festival . festival , way , Moore 's propaganda nonsense epitome worthless somewhat exotic weirdness , became festival vapid ludicrous.Sic transit gloria mundi !
 ? main question movie . watched movie n't yet devoted follower . wanted enjoy Asian movie friend recommended . like many Asian movie fairly high hope . tell rating disappointed.Why movie high rating ? seeing ? start nice enough premise . guy imprisoned 15 year idea ? , suddenly released , trying find deserve . Well , could something ! could . , least , seemed script n't quite know go . Instead lack coherent script covered lot lot violence . quite obvious violence used shock awe , n't make good movie.The two big twist utter letdown . reason imprisonment joke . 've gone complete lack reason , like Cube . , dumb . incest theme also seems serve purpose shock people.Maybe old watch movie shocking . certainly n't think movie good trying hard break many taboo possible.There absolutely nothing set movie apart many movie . great achievement acting , story , script , music , cinematography . Absolutely none . Yet receives high rating . really n't understand .
 Hollywood slowly choking death clichés unrealistic budget , movie lover turn attention Asia . Especially interesting Korea 's emerging movie industry . Japan long tradition quality horror anime China dominates epic state-sponsored spectacle . place Korea take n't know Oldboy inclination would intelligent , disturbing drama-action movies.Oldboy extremely intelligent edgy script , make think question moral . would NEVER picked Hollywood . Even initial concept locked 15 year without apparent reason would deemed strange audience . Thankfully , Korean producer could see brilliance script give shot . 's budget $ 4 million , amazingly well used.Oldboy much child 's director , Chan-Wook Park , 's name warrant lot fame . camera-work pacing amazing . virtually dull moment . fighting scene used compliment movie , give reward half hour 's boredom.The lead actor le amazing . Min-Sik Choi perfect anti-hero . Unlike Western antihero , even look everyman , make transformation much spectacular . lead actress bit understates opinion , memorable never le . best one far Ji-Tae Ju , charismatic villain . dominates every scene 's , sort Korean Christian Bale American Psycho.Music choreography great well . detail grit make movie really come alive . end , awe , rare feeling movie . feeling stay day . Occasionally think movie shake head , unbelieving someone could actually pull off.So favor , watch Oldboy . disappointed .
 Please blame Korea bad movie . Korea ( please excuse bad English ) . sadden see movie make Korea look like obsessed blood sex . sadden even see animal killing hear Americans say Korea . eat live animal ! ! please stop excusing movie crime saying culture ! scene man eating live animal non Koreans think normal . disgusting u . director misfit , sick individual obsession killing sex family member . wish America France stop glorifying bad man laughable country . Please watch movie Korea , give idea artistic really . movie rubbish .

Perhaps metaphor power consume life dominate . See , remember film school too.Anyways , absurdity guy locked , really seeking revenge plot detail better left unsaid , actually quite disgusting . fact , movie nothing like thought would be.I thought would lot stylized action . Either director n't know stage action , n't know . could great fight sequence beginning young punk , camera turn away . Later , `` big fight scene '' , Oh fight literally dozen guy stick , armed hammer . fight choreography , real action , slow camera track .

 reading comment IMDb time . 8.3 average movie plain get nerve . n't mean pull one `` signed account post movie '' bit ... .. , . theme come away movie incest deserve ridiculed.Now , realize many 'hoity-toity ' film people love movie ; nevertheless , crap . thing REALLY get fact director expects sympathy 'villain ' movie . sexual relation sister , probably outcast society . personal feeling guess . Yet , sat 2 hour *expletive* expecting really deep reasoning behind Dae-Soo 's imprisonment.I tend like lot foreign movie , first encounter Korean flick put last line book . Oh ... feel better already little venting .
 Old Boy favourite film . far see , amount superlative could explain quite much love . first viewing , ( lonesome ) realised probably n't blinked entirety could quite possibly burgled course none wiser , extent found totally utterly engrossing . Obviously review consisting little spewing praise would fairly dull read never bothered review Old Boy second viewing , Po ' . father eternal sceptic turned extremely worthy person watch film , response opened eye little love much.The plot follows . protagonist Oh Dae-Su one day captured find locked makeshift prison . brief spell anger spewing hatred captor , resigns fate , 15 year shadow boxing suicide attempt wake gas induced coma top tower block initially seized . proceeds try find , film basically chart quest.The first word spring mind thinking film graphic . certain scene make nervous disposition recoil firmly wedged back seat sofa , likely spend much film violence frequent . extreme case simply implication violence viewer 's imagination left device like cause disgust . hurdle huge thing problem dad , considered violence gratuitous , somewhat agree , although certain scene completely integral plot . best way justify scene simple . sending message , . cope break initial barrier film leaf lying way enjoyment.Another barrier massive culture shock experienced viewing film . Korean language film adapted Japanese animé series , obviously large cultural difference western world . image used require quite thought fully understand , script translation lose flow , animé graphic novel fan associate . father , made hard settle flow film , identify slightly early day watching animé.Many theme pick method direction synonymous Quentin Tarantino . device used film obviously taken inspiration Tarantino 's work , particular Pulp Fiction- esquire use camera angle , famous dotted line sequence . However , Tarantino huge fan Old Boy , main advocate win 2003 Palme d'Or ( eventually lost Fahrenheit 9/11 ) stated Park Chan-Wook influence directing style Kill Bill series , well later grindhouse work Death Proof Planet Terror . Chan-Wook take policy `` trust director '' , leaf many question throughout film give somewhat disorientating feel time . method directing seem quite inaccessible , however loose end tied satisfactorily enthralling shocking climax . ending rival classic Kaiser Sozé twist tail Usual Suspects.What really separated elevates Chan-Wook 's work beyond Tarantino 's however simple . Much Tarantino 's work undertaken exercise direction film making , therefore work therefore feel shallow . Old Boy however film ass deepest corner human heart . middle three film make Chan-Wook 's Vengeance Trilogy undoubtedly masterpiece , powerful message Lady Vengeance Sympathy Mr. Vengeance . film power depth explores flaw force human heart posse , stronger destructive wisdom overcome . performance main cast importantly director send message viewer leave film close perfection see film getting .

Well n't since ca n't understand 's liked & would go far say pretty much hated apart one two isolated moment . start could n't get story , n't like thought slow & boring & many would believe Oldboy bestest shocking twist ever thought rather plain & well executed either . ending Dae-su go New Zealand Alps hypnotised feel tagged well almost maker wanted sort happy ending . almost two hour almost fell asleep bored , violence tame & 's thought 's happening would imagine people problem rather actually shown . fact Oldboy low body count seven & one mild sex scene , 's really graphic memorable . n't warm character 's & accept Oldboy alright concept & premise fails deliver & 's one film never understand many people seem like.Based Japanese Manga name Oldboy film look alright , 's one two nice visual moment although everyone raf hallway fight take place one continuous shot pretty unimpressed & thought fight choreography quite dull . actual on-screen gore violence amount little , Dae-su eats live Octopus apparently quite normal Korea anyway , fight scene , severed hand , someone teeth pulled & 's bit blood end.The budget supposedly around $ 4,000,000 mark actually fair bit , filmed South Korea & New Zealand . acting look alright 's hard tell actor speaking different language.Oldboy film found absolute chore sit , n't mind subtitled film foreign film paying attention plot followed thing perfectly n't like & 's simple & straightforward . Apparently second director Choi-wook Park 's revenge trilogy also includes Sympathy Mr. Vengeance ( 2002 ) & Lady Vengeance ( 2005 ) .

 worst high budget movie ever made . almost gave away free saw . First back movie say brutal scene torture , could n't wait see . Finally th main character pluck guy teeth hammer camera turn away . Every scene violence movie n't show . expecting good story might stay interested 28 minute start wondering care anymore . seems like director made story making movie cause stupidest plot twist could think .

 watched movie needed get mind painful hemorrhoid . Sure enough , forgot roids busy trying put eyeball back socket gouging Big Gulp straw . 's bad movie . kidding . looked around theater ( managing pop peeper back ) saw le 64 people also struggling gouged eyeball . 12 hung twizzlers . One kid seemed enjoying movie , also seemed enjoying booger collection , maybe question must ask paying see movie , enjoy booger collection ? Well , ? Oh another reason like movie . enjoy watching animal get killed ( real life ) , movie . since kind people also enjoy booger collection , guess point redundant .
 look award title , see critic worldwide rated film highly came . story one already remade Americans - man imprisoned 15 year someone never seen , released - given cellphone five day find imprisoned identify captor .

Sadly , always case mass murder , medium public looking easy solution Cho Seung-Hui murdered American student rampage . pictured pose press tagged struck OLDBOY used soldier , terrorist nutter . 'm sorry film borne brunt backlash - Cho Seung-Hui mentally ill - film cause go mad , sick . Back movie , stick viewer watching . 'm glad DVD copy .
 's thin line theatrical plain forced . Forced acting . Forced take . Forced plot . Even forced photography . 's people say `` movie develops way 's Asia '' n't see kind forced element Seven Samurai Sonatine . 's thin line fiction ( every work art , 's way , fiction ) unlikely.In personal way , n't feel anything movie , n't take anywhere , ca n't believe fictional world proposed . n't feel right , 's something n't click .
 Park Chan-wook absorbed academic darling like Tarkovsky , Bergman , Lynch , Godard Hitchcock like sponge without really thinking temper artistic voice ; result self-serving gimmicky.This polished whodunnit mystery fluff ten contrivance every single good idea . Oh , bad guy 's got button inject poison heart kill press ? course , . n't mind pulp , n't want pulp slicked , filled classical music eye-rolling `` magical realism '' touch , generally propped pedestal Important Statements make.It 's easy see appeal : hit mark `` foreign film '' ( wholly useless categorization ) supposed hit , according market . 's rife potential cultural dissonance ( 's lot `` deep meaning '' octopus scene , would n't get ! ) , 's `` artsy '' , yet violent shocking ( read somewhere Asian film supposed violent , yeah ? ) . 's dumb , mediocre film right place right time .
 `` Vengeance '' trilogy Pak Chan-wook , Oldboy probably best , followed Sympathy Lady Vengeance . Simple story , `` low budget '' actor already know Sympathy Mr. Vengeance . Although fan Korean movie , 've heard movie 's plot first time , thought `` oh god , another sponsored-by-tomato-factory movie '' . watched first time two year released . honest , surprised . Since , watched movie ten time still find interesting . , Oldboy best Korean movie ever made . Maybe best Asian movie last 20 years.I recommend watch , along Sympathy Lady Vengeance Sympathy Mr. Vengeance . 'll also surprised find actors.10/10
 thought possibly one stupidest , melodramatic , hyped movie ever recommended . First , 'll admit n't like movie Se7en . like Se7en , may like Oldboy . However , like David Fincher . particular like use still imagery , high contrasting color , etc . director borrowed lot . also like scene main character stuck inside prison 15 year without explanation . However , learned end put prison arch-rival wanted go excruciating extent seek revenge thought ridiculous reason , ticked . First , arch rival dropped sister bridge , okay ? could 've lived , drama queen decided drop bridge drama queen . drama queen ? main character started rumor slept arch-rival ( , incest ) . arch rival killed sister drama queen drama queen . , apparently thought worth sticking main character prison 15 year tricking sleeping daughter . main character react find ? apologizes melodramatic way proceeds cut tongue . Uhmmm ... already slept daughter , n't know felt worth getting arch rival 's apology bad felt cut tongue get . Also , connect main character eating live squid arch rival well thought plan get sleep daughter . stupid attempt trying make everything meaning within movie . could n't felt like eating live squid ? would 've liked better . felt like director wanted throw lot thing felt cool together even though main storyline STUPID ! ! ! apparently people liked MUCH 're making remake movie U.S . RARRRR ! ! ! Well , 'm done venting frustration , like everything movie actually tried make pathetic excuse plot . wish could 've much better story prison 15 year part cool . think director trying thing cool , would actually good put together . Editing good . Production good . Acting good . ca n't remember music , lol . 'm interested watching critique . Directing good . Cinematography good . come better plot please . reason think deserves 6/10 . think le produced movie thought put storyline would 've WAY better . 'm already used seeing Hollywood churn overproduced movie . thing n't impress .

Since could said Big Sleep many still , may critical head-shaking 'Oldboy ' seem passé time film morph classic .

 read review `` Oldboy '' year ago since read praise movie IMDb poster . Often time movie kind hype tend fall short major disappointment . n't know anything Korean cinema fairly low expectation . expected simplistic revenge film , shot bad film stock . Well say 'm glad wrong , even gladder still actually watched film.The basic story man named Oh Dae-Su kidnapped held captive 18 year released . idea done . captivity ready day get take revenge imprisoned , find imprisoned . far sound like old revenge martial art flick point pretty much , 's incredibly well crafted . admit paid much attention Asian martial art film since Bruce Lee died maybe . Mainly movie n't jumpy camera work , bad editing old flick . movie crisply shot Scorcese film . alone elevates movie higher plateau.Once released , Oh Dae-Su go quest find happened family find identity captured . quest bad guy , movie played like old fashioned detective movie . search n't rushed neither boring . suppose set made u want go quest Oh Dae-Su sound like Odysseus , Odysseus went one incredible quest Oh Dae-Su.It 's find man held captive movie truly departs average revenge film something extra ordinary extraordinarily disturbing . 's point say le said better . 's something totally ordinary something think repulse viewer , time one ca n't help sympathy character even man ordered Oh 's incarceration . acting movie excellent . idea Korean cinema skillful actor . really played part incredibly well . Min-sik Choi , played Oh Dae-Su incredible . go rigor desperate captive , determined man mission . Along way run gamut much emotion hit false note . Overall say movie incredibly well crafted good everybody say , however find little disturbing ca n't give movie ten . n't let giving film ten scare away 's good , enjoyable film .
 man imprisoned 15 year released ; must find imprisoned.The film realistic gritty fight scene well strange yet alluring special effect ; brilliantly done lead actor fantastic portraying conflicted individual.The film shocking say least , end squirming truth revealed lover far vengeful enemy go destroy already chaos filled existence.The fight scene long hall still main attraction though hammer punch way endless number enemy ; beautifully shot definitely must see .
 start saying Chan-wook Park film making genius , maybe Quentin Tarantino Korea . plot original character development cinematography really well done . revenge story grip beginning end , especially end . movie must see , even weak stomach go watch anyways , cause `` thats f***** '' moment , fight scene realistic . going ruin anything movie give away pot , say watch damn movie . Korean film making 's best.9.2/10
 time favorite movie , though critic never agree.There enough summary movie read 'll skip part love movie.It 's gritty personal , emotional roller coaster . fact many people posting disturbed watching movie proof powerful . Yes , point movie disgusting , never exploitative manner dominates torture porn . violent sequence screen , disgust head ( something talented director pull ) .The soundtrack amazing . Editing amazing . n't ever notice camera angle switch , cut scene scene seamless.Acting amazing . story amazing . people say 's unrealistic , really depends much 're willing suspend disbelief . n't feel like particularly hard accept , especially got movie . Plus , story written poetic symmetry justifies anything people might say `` ridiculous '' .Honestly , wish could watch movie first time . 's really amazing experience.Oldboy thought-provoking visceral time . emotional spectrum movie wide movie get . 's entertaining , yet show mastery art film .
 Unfortunately , native speaker , comment profoundly movie would like . still , review inflict pain reading.I , personally , primarily appreciate film aesthetic value . camera perspective , color , musical underlining fact brilliant , acting ; question taste part rating.What actually seems widely misunderstood `` story '' `` meaning '' film . Actually , point none ; main character almighty powerless ; violence appeasement lead nothing ; character one-dimensional completely determined surroundings ; every twist plot seems come nowhere . movie plain nihilistic - point trying change anything , ending already set mysterious force . Complaining senseless violence sex scene downright stupid context . Life perceived like , perspective film want offer . doese n't correspond , understand must pretty harsh viewer.My recommendation : Maybe , reading `` La Nausee '' Sartre ( seeing two piece trilogy , opt graphical display ) help understand masterpiece . , well , whatever .
 'm sorry , ca n't understand user site shun Oldboy much.I think brilliant film , yes artistic avant garde tendency . thing , n't watch it.I , however , think masterpiece . level engagement actor create story brilliant . People simply overlooking fact incest huge tragic flaw . brilliant , slightly surreal moment , think make film.The camera work something creative , moment paying homage comic , films.I love much , taken story physical theatre created something new . done pay tribute phenomenal film.Brilliant , question asked ...
 experienced breathtaking Oldboy , word praise . always reticent write review IMDb feel film totally worth writing , first review many way , reminds also fabulous Fight Club , mainly grittiness , touch surrealism fantasy , thickness plot . constantly pushed friend watch Oldboy always insisted brilliance . quite , refused watch believing would simply another excessively gory graphic Asian film , wrong . read many review people criticising violence , admit fan gory movie per se . However , okay occasional gore long main focus film . Oldboy 's case , violence small ( necessary ) part much bigger . film take away roller-coaster ride human emotion , brilliant plot , sheer brilliance . acting absolutely superb , smallest biggest character , believing along storyline . directing beautiful , fantastic dark photography sense `` doom '' throughout film.Even though plot beginning difficult grasp , eventually impossible stop watching film draw inevitable conclusion . Oh Daesu plight central theme , underlying theme Asian society , rigidness importance saving face . Also interesting director 's ambiguous position regarding revenge , treated analgesic something avoided . Human endurance order achieve goal also important part film , Daesu put hell order find truth bring forth revenge.Even though film light hearted , enjoying light-hearted entertainment , however masterpiece wonderfully original time film looking sell well box office . must see enjoy quality cinema best , , fully deserves highest praise . given film 10 10 thoroughly encourage everyone watch , since would tragedy miss fabulous film-making .
 amazing film . say though , American n't speak Korean , crucial watch someone . know would n't able understand lot subtlety n't friend pause movie occasionally tell happened . disturbing film time probably cringed enough liking . 'd say strongest point acting script . Every character utterly believable . Especially main character , Oh Deseau . rarely sympathized character movie much . 15 year ? 's ridiculous . far script go ... wow . 's probably one best script ever written history film . ending much . compare anything else 'd say 's lot like Audition meet Seven . highly recommend film anyone strong stomach love thriller surprise .
 saw movie yesterday . disturbing movie ever seen . masterpiece confusing.Those care movie find movie brilliant piece work . seen Mr. Park 's `` cut '' part movie `` Three ... Extreme '' , dint know oldboy one work . sad movie , destroying man part part , sick game character `` wo jin '' played villain . sick story vengeance.After nthe end , daeso want forget ? ever met mido ? know mido daughter ? director end movie viewer open interpretation . hug end daeso act strange , question seen , 1. wanted forget mido daughter 2. wanted erase every memory mido ? cant supported erase secret daughter , cause even lead sick life cant acceptable . decision forgetting important me.I cant see , wont get head month think . re-watching movie finding answer good idea . make sad .
 ca n't remember last time enjoyed film much one.The key premise original , rare enough , add good writing get great film.There deliberately hammed comic moment lighten mostly dark mood film genuinely funny.The action often top , gory way , interesting watch story unfold viewer idea happening protagonist.The pace quick enough never get bored ending dark nasty twisted surprising.There nothing bad say film .
 Oldboy call sick master piece south Koreans . Film well plotted direction excellent . one film never allowed Hollywood , Bollywood remake . original.This Asian cinema best.In realm revenge thriller , 'd hard pressed find ultra-violent vengeance psycho thrill creepy story Oldboy . watch film offended , look greater aspect movie enjoy it.Oldboy deserves watched appreciated .
 movie actually Woo-Jin 's revenge Dae-Su 's Dae-Su absolutely nothing ( post-imprisonment ) hurt guy wronged . mean , knocked around couple henchman Woo-Jin obviously n't care blew bodyguard head could n't hear . going make movie revenge , protagonist better reason kid spreading rumour incestuous affair . Plus , bullshit getting pregnant believed rumour ? suppose pregnancy test doctor day age . add insult injury , hypnotist end tell Dae-Su n't deserve help except even beast deserve live . rationalize helping Woo-Jin Dae-Su . 'm surprised n't try killed part played predicament . Plus , wiping Dae-Su 's memory leaving daughter 's memory intact allows fall love without burden guilt . Kinda make tongue-cutting sacrifice seem pointless ask . 've heard lot movie high rating expected lot .
 Sometimes life , one face awful situation death . oldboy , witness situation like this..I heard many people saying Korean picture , watched sm , honestly say , dis korean stuff , truly amazing , could thrown shadow sadness many hour even watchn film . rare , rare , man like man remain sad aft watchin movie , wht condition others ? ca n't even imagine that..Truly painful , brilliantly twisted story , best twisted film hv ever seen..
 n't understand fuss movie..i watched high rating..it 's good movie relax people major flaw ... n't liked : hypnosis n't work way guy ... biggest bullshit ever , EARTH N'T REMEMBERED DAUGHTER DAUGHTER REMEMBERED HIM.. ? ? returned homeland 17 year still remembered every person left 5 year old kid ... .and also Dae-Su Woo-jinLee seem like 15-20 year age difference come classmates.. ? ? know prison make look older n't think much ... last thing , Woo-jin Lee look like maximum 30 year old guy took 15 year Dae-su prison would assume school took Dae-su 5 year make family ... sum Woo-jin must like 5-10 year old made sister Dae-su would 15-20 year old guy going primary school ... .major flaw guy
 watch movie emotion , right ? warned : watching Oldboy , 'll feel nothing disappointment ! plot weak used violence torture scene keep u awake . manage keep two hour watching cause 're curious reason main character kidnapped first place , prepared sorry time wasted . director obviously realized got poorest plot history cinema try apology giving u stupidly violent scene ... Unfortunately make watchable !
 believe wasted even 20 minute load **** . 's like watching Fox News . u perspicacity shut thing infects soul . Others , unfortunately , mesmerized gruesome , lascivious , childish appeal end spending hour sucked in.It stupid story stupid violence , stupid sex , stupid animal cruelty , stupid pedophilia , stupid incest , stupid thing . thing missing bunch car commercial , truly WOULD Fox News.I disheartened Korea sinking level America 's worst trait . Instead pursuing rich culture historical tradition philosophical art , 're trying imitate mindless trash broadcast Hollywood . film pinnacle wasted effort .
 ... ca n't rate 0/10 ( sadly IMDb n't give choice ) . also make wonder anyone would like movie story . Yes real story , guy get imprisoned monitored 15 year , happened see banging sister . Wow , 're talking twisted mind here.It 's hate violence . seen movie made Lars Von Trier ? , violence point . , happens , order shock reason whatsoever . explanation make sense , especially end , imprisoned guy learns `` programmed fall asleep '' daughter touched , could take home . course , make fall love . n't program fall love first place ? anyone ( mean - anyone ) say n't done would difficult , 'm gon na bang head wall.Oh , remember happens final scene . guy era memory , wo n't remember girl daughter . happens , meet , movie tell u 'll fall love . director probably crazy . Please leave alone open .
 really understand movie made top 250 . found pervert hard watch . like . Incest , violence . dark upsetting movie . saw 7 year ago remember whole thing remember bad movie . like plot , filming , actor . Please someone explain movie thought top one . Plus saw DVD club movie called Oldboy American actor . actually make remake ? totally recommend . Plus Korean actor acted real sociopath . know whether admire kind dedication role afraid .
 obscure Cannes prizewinner lot gore incest fairly boring character weirdly improbable thing . Essentially man imprisoned fifteen year look like private prison . release vow vengeance , discovers man imprisoned revenge something , first man , done . Lots arty camera-work , nothing make credibility story.What come translation imprisonment worked : appeared private company would imprison people money , mechanic stretched credibility .
 First , 'm going confess seeing dubbed version advise anyone wanting see movie try see subtitled version . version n't available time , think would 've liked movie lot , stand , n't impressed , struggled get . shame , looked like performance really good . n't even know dub movie day . law something . digress.This movie definitely different , benefit foreign film 're almost always going get something stylistically 's little different American film . angle , interesting movie . 's also cringe inducing necessarily meant squeamish , violence reason entirely unjustified , good.The story follows middle aged guy named Oh-dae-su . Oh-dae-su n't bad guy , knack trouble thing like getting drunk missing daughter 's birthday , 's admirable fellow either , 's kinda make interesting . Unexpectedly , get kidnapped held prisoner look like hotel room , except iron door locking , room stay 15 year one day unexpectedly released . come changed man , rest film deal seeking revenge captor finding imprisoned.I somewhat disappointed , beginning film , expecting something along line introspective look human condition , turned regular action thriller choreographed fight sequence diabolical plot aim pretty close heart , completely far fetched . contrary review 've read film , actually found ending slightly predictable . could n't entirely buy story.Overall 's pretty well directed time in-cohesive scene change give little explanation 's even going . Perhaps intentional allow viewer relate main character 's bizarre set circumstance , way shot assembled , feel like movie either rushed uncompleted.And despite good performance around , casting decision made sense . example , one major character played actor look 15 20 year young particular role , based information 're given character . major gripe , irritated throughout film , made movie slightly harder follow , intended way.Again , know would 've liked subtitle , may go back watch subtitled version point re-evaluation , movie n't really leave enough impression time soon .
 `` Oldboy '' ( 2003 ) greatly overrated 8.4 IMDb , judgment . 'd say 's close average among current movie . biggest negative weak disappointing story , stretched 2 hour . strength good acting production set design.This movie heavy violence disturbing image time . accessible child . `` Oldboy '' dwells revenge plot . Ji-tae Yu considers Min-sik Choi wronged sister , committed suicide Yu actually complicit . Consequently kidnaps hold captive 15 year . hypnotizes otherwise manipulates release . Choi seek revenge understanding held captive released.This movie reflects age live dying decadent culture immersed , emphasizes sens , might , egoism , power de-emphasizes spirituality , transcendent value , altruism . Yu exercise almost complete power Choi , manipulating almost , Yu really guilty one . 's projecting guilt onto Choi blaming him.The ending optimistic side , allowing Choi recover hope leading happier life . However , extreme graphic way story led outcome suggests outcome precarious thing enormous pain suffering dominant strain living.Some reviewer like movie technique certain shocking scene . horror movie fan , blood , torture gross scene look real , better . unrealistic fight scene becomes something viewer see plus movie . movie exploiting perverse taste , part age decadence . ending light le fully convincing . dominant impression movie leaf distasteful , twisted man gone extreme . say life cruel God must therefore cruel one .
 waited many year watch Old Boy Call delayed gratification . found darkness grittiness attractive . hallway scene fight scene mostly satisfying . Oh Dae-Su 's toughness inspirational . shot well , sound good acting great , especially Min-Sik Choi . disappointing , frustrating dissatisfying film 've ever seen.The revelation Oh Dae-Su imprisoned subsequent action illogical enraged.I convinced filmmaker playing joke viewing public Ha , ha , funny Mr. Park ... , want money back .
 *SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS* n't know movie high rating . Maybe 's Quentin Tarantino like , people feel like like ? know . heard rumor Hollywood want make American remake one . Spielberg supposed director Smith main star . ca n't imagine , hey . whole world getting crazier day , .The movie based comic book n't heard read . 's manga , expect lot kung fu fight , shouting twisted psychology.I treat `` Oldboy '' thriller . 'm watching thriller 'm expecting logic . n't know viewer liked `` Oldboy '' treat sort fantasy , total disaster term realism logic.1 ) hero prisoner . 's locked apartment . middle city . WHOLE building prison , EVERY apartment basically cage . thought kidnap somebody hide outside city limit something like 2 ) hero 15 YEARS EATS MEAL breakfast , lunch dinner . vitamin , protein ? week would sick . month would probably die . Yet , 's alive good health . Magic , guess 's terminator.3 ) ca n't hypnotize anybody . need patient cooperate hypnotist.4 ) wo n't learn kung fu PUNCHING WALL ONE FIST 15 YEARS.5 ) guess eating live octopus deep symbol something 6 ) rape woman elevator walk away problem . Despite least two witness , police wont even searching you.7 ) love hero important female character nonexistent , despite movie tell u 8 ) hero age villain . went school , year , class .

Judging look hero could father ! 9 ) sex scene one awful sex scene 've ever seen.10 ) defeat army opponent problem , yet angry one guy defeat without problem.11 ) 's woman ? help villain beginning ? help hero end ? personal reason ? 12 ) ending message beautiful  incest good long nobody know . Brother sister father daughter LOVE EMOTIONALLY , ALSO PSYCHICALLY wrong people ? logic good taste ? movie feel like adaptation one porn fan-fiction Internet full . Incest appeared one famous movie 70 's , movie never said good thing ! 's `` message '' saw . author comic book , creator movie fan movie need locked mental hospital.I give 2/10 , music beautiful .
 Fortunately self-trained action hero enemy conveniently attack one time ignore effect stabbing back , comical fight scene akin Peter Griffin fighting giant chicken.An 's entire premise film : elaborate revenge scheme 15 year making , bad guy imprisons father raise daughter 15 year using hypnotism make two fall love . Reminds `` protocol driod 's mind wiped . '' convenient way cover ridiculous plot.I feel octoped die make rubbish .
 movie highly regarded expecting see something unique appealing . Unique - yes . Appealing - no.First , time movie contains scene contribute plot simply disgust ( eating live Octopus ) , write cheap flick looking impress teenager young adult cling thing like that.But really got movie ending . oh main character cut tongue bark like dog ? 15 year enough ? Everyone spread rumor . guy 's sister psycho . killed nut . rumor . one sex brother first place , knew screw loose first place . bound kill , rumor . movie made someone brain , main character would beat incestuous brother found screwing daughter due 15 year hypnosis ordered sister-screwer.The reaction cutting tongue unique one 99.99999 % people would n't done situation . people would like , `` wrong , psychotic sister screwer ? lock 15 year hypnotize screw daughter revenge piddly high school rumor ? Seriously ? '' would beat ground , pulled teeth thrown window . would much better ending overdone overly gory ( coming someone like Saw movie ) movie . know 'm one think people watching movie completely agreed main character stupid cutting tongue barking like dog .
 *****Classic ****Excellent ***Good **Fair *TragicReview : Oldboy everyone . 's pervasive violence , live octopus eating 's unimaginary story.The film focus around man 's kidnapped imprisoned 15 year , Oh Dae-Su released , find must find captor 5 day . story though may seem gripping start watching bloated un-original blood fest develops mash bitter blood forceful film.It 's directing par average mean standard South Korean thriller . Oldboys acting scene paralleled dull humour poorly writtern script.Oldboy occasionlly presented thin straw performance one could feel shameful about.Verdict : everyone 's scope vision n't clear enough see grey abyss fog . *Tragic

Additionally , filming design creates beautiful visual experience . Oldboy visual masterpiece , like 2001 : Space Odyssey ( 1968 ) , detracts main purpose raw emotion movie.It 's like Memento ( 2000 ) steroid , Room ( 2015 ) even intensity . Yet miss mark completely . emotion felt , lost confusing whirlwind story . Park throw viewer Land Oz lost wondering Kansas went . Tears shed tragedy Dae-su Oh , instead tear wept lost potential visually perfect , emotionally incomplete film .

 classic Korean revenge film developed mastermind Chan-wook Park could n't better become . movie attributed rather love hate personality introduction American public rather explicit disturbing scene sex . entirely understand concept brutality ; great homage film-noir attempt break every boundary become one darkest film ever created without actual horror.During 15 year imprisonment scene character lost possible nature forced become animal . Masterbating dancing woman . Writing journal would put pain . Training combat punching wall . Slowly cutting brick least feel breeze outside rain trickle hand even attempting smash head glass attempt kill himself.All character lost spiral insanity solitary confinement . Upon release character regain ability live society . learn new word , learn laugh , love , feel guilt sorrow cry . character development beautiful soundtrack mixed classical techno themes.Only flaw movie would one scene Oh Dae-su take roll super-man clean underground scum . n't enough interrupt brilliance movie . time lying ground grin face put cigarette mouth time he walking away laughing man fallen roof onto car.In end movie make laugh . make cry behalf lost film industry Korea . remember laugh , world laugh cry , cry alone .
 Let get way trash film : love Park Chan-Wook 's work director . disagree mass saying 's best director working time , ca n't deny understands use camera effectively . really liked one film , Sympathy Mr. Vengeance . Also , Min-sik Choi 's acting thing allowed take film seriously . . . 1/5 runtime , is.Now bad : plot simply oldest cliché used cinema/literature . 'll never understand critic trash Hollywood blockbuster cliché , hail movie like Oldboy unoriginal clichéd even . Regardless , Oldboy flat-out one generic , unoriginal movie ever conceived . *Spoilers* Man held captive , man seek revenge , man find sex family member , man 's life . *End spoilers* Simply put , plot line used everything Greek play modern melodramatic soap opera countless movies/books . melodramatic unoriginal major reveal happens , laughed loud . mean 'm desensitized freak without emotion review film say people like ? . mean overdone plot make people laugh . Scary Movie franchise proved , Oldboy proved well . ca n't people think something truly disturbing instead spewing tried clichés masked fancy camera-work classical music ? brings issue blood/gore . Simply put , n't . director timid even point camera screen something `` gory '' happens , 're watching child 's movie something . Maybe . Anyway , 've heard Oldboy called `` brutal movie time '' `` disturbing movie ever '' watched failed see ANYTHING even remotely gory disturbing . `` gore '' off-screen , even violence level nothing n't seen PG-13 movie like Dark Knight Casino Royale . even got R-rating confuses , much le `` brutal movie time '' . Seriously , 've seen movie make Oldboy look cute every level come violence/gore.The huge glaring , cheesy flaw main villain . majority screen time 's showing bare butt audience comedic American Pie-style , 'm supposed think 's oh-so-evil ? 's wearing clothes , hair slicked back like bad Asian mix cheesiest James Bond villain mixed something Austin Powers . talk like brain-dead teenager recovering acid overdose , dialogue bad laughing yet . Seriously , Oldboy laughing comedy year . . .In end , Oldboy sip fine wine , sense humor , talk boring life dinner party . 's people stuck ego forgot unoriginal , consequently forgot unoriginal boring `` film '' ( never `` movie '' ) enjoy are.To people say : like `` film '' also like `` movie '' . like thoughtful drama actually say something human condition , also like pointless action movie thrill coma . thing , like `` film '' `` movie '' , original . something n't seen many time lost count number time plot used . something n't original , 's expendable . exactly everyone else , 's forgettable boring . give Oldboy yet another perfect rating `` touched '' , maybe think something : would n't movie equally touching , time original make think ? wish someone would understand this.Overall : Oldboy forgettable cheesy.1/10
